or reject the contract within a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment, the receiver is
deemed to have rejected the contract.
3. A receiver's performance of an executory contract before court approval under subsection 2 o f
its adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the contract and does not preclude the receiver
from seeking approval to reject the contract.
4. A provision in an executory contract which requires or permits a forfeiture, modification, or
termination of the contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the financial condition
of the owner does not affect a receiver's power under subsection 2 to adopt the contract .

property that is real property in possession of the purchaser or a rea l - property timeshare

a. Treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, and in that case the purchaser has a
lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the purchaser paid;
or
b. Retain the purchaser's right to possession under the contract, and in that case the
purchaser shall continue to perform all obligations arising under the contract and may
offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the
date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or claim against other receivership
property or the receiver on account of the damages.
8. A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owner is the
landlord if:
a. The tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenant's primary residence;

senior lien under which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the

26 proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

30 changes made to the proposed rule and reasons for substantive changes not

1 c. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except
2 for an emergency as provided in subsection 12, the effective date of the rule may
3 not be sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that the commission
4 adopted or amended the rule.
5 12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and
6 adopt an emergency rule with forty-eight hours' notice, with opportunity to comment,
7 provided the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section

20 any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged if
21 the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing
22 and delivered to the commission before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
23 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged,
24 the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
25 14. A member state's rulemaking requirements do not apply under this compact.

8 similar matter.
9 c. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
10 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to
11 intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission

13 compact, or adopted rules.
14 2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.

16 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the adopted rules, the

22 states.
23 3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
24 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the
25 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
26 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
27 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
28 period of default.
29 4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means
30 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
31 must be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of

28 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial
29 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the
30 litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein may not be

18 a. The licensee immediately shall apply for the reissuance of the licensee's
19 multistate license in the licensee's new home state. The licensee shall pay all

9 apply its own state law to determine appropriate action.
10 3. The home state shall complete any pending investigation of a regulated social worker
11 who changes their home state during the course of the investigation. The home state
12 also has the authority to take appropriate action and promptly shall report the

14 administrator of the data system promptly shall notify the new home state of any
15 adverse actions.
16 4. A member state may recover the costs of an investigation and disposition of a case

18 regulated social worker against which the action was taken, if otherwise allowed by
19 state law.

7 administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system promptly shall
8 notify the home state and all other member states of any adverse actions by remote
9 states.
10 9. This compact does not override a member state's decision that participation in an
11 alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.
12 10. This compact does not authorize a member state to demand the issuance of a
13 subpoena for attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence
14 from another member state for lawful actions within that member state.
15 11. This compact does not authorize a member state to impose discipline against a
16 regulated social worker who holds a multistate authorization to practice for lawful

26 proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

1 c. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except
2 for an emergency as provided in subsection 12, the effective date of the rule may
3 not be sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that the commission
4 adopted or amended the rule.
5 12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and

20 any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged if
21 the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing
22 and delivered to the commission before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
23 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged,
24 the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
25 14. A member state's rulemaking requirements do not apply under this compact.

8 similar matter.
9 c. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
10 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to

16 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the adopted rules, the

24 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the
25 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
26 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
27 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
28 period of default.
29 4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means
30 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
31 must be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of

act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties,
or responsibilities, or that the person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within
the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided the actual or
alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton
misconduct by that person.
d. This compact may not be construed to limit the liability of a licensee for professional
malpractice or misconduct, which is solely governed by any other applicable state laws.
e. This compact may not be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or
anticompetitive law or regulation.
f. This compact may not be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the member
states or by the commission.

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 15
d. Nonconfidential information related to alternative program participation, the beginning
and ending dates of the participation, and other information related to the participation
not made confidential under member state law;
e. Any denial of an application for licensure, and the reason for the denial;
f. The presence of current significant investigative information; and
g. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact or the protection
of the public, as determined by the rules of the commission.
4. The records and information provided to a member state under this compact or through the
data system, when certified by the commission or an agent of the commission, constitutes the
authenticated business records of the commission, and is entitled to any associated hearsay

state.
5. Current significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any member state only
will be available to other member states. It is the responsibility of the member states to report
any adverse action against a licensee and to monitor the database to determine whether
adverse action has been taken against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to a
licensee in any member state will be available to any other member state.
6. Member states contributing information to the data system may designate information that
may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state.
7. Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged under federal law
or the laws of the member state contributing the information must be removed from the data
system.
ARTICLE XII - RULEMAKING
1. The commission shall adopt reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently implement and
administer the purpose and provisions of the compact. A rule is invalid if a court of competent
jurisdiction holds the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority
in a manner beyond the scope and purpose of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder,
or based upon another applicable standard of review.
2. The rules of the commission have the force of law in each member state. If the rules of the
commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the member state's laws,
regulations, and applicable standards that govern the practice of social work as held by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission are ineffective in that state to the
extent of the conflict.
3. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers under the criteria provided in this
section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules are binding on the day following adoption or
the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
4. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states reject a rule or portion of a rule, by
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four
years of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
member state.
5. Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
6. Before the adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
individuals to provide oral and written comments.

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 16
7. Before the adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least thirty days before the
meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the
commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
a. On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
b. To persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed
rulemaking; and
c. In other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
8. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
a. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear
public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
b. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means,
the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
c. The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the rule;
d. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
e. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
9. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
10. This article may not be construed to require a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be
grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
11. The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
a. The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not
enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
b. The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
made to the proposed rule and reasons for substantive changes not made that were
recommended by commenters.
c. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
emergency as provided in subsection 12, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner
than thirty days after issuing the notice that the commission adopted or amended the
rule.
12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
emergency rule with forty-eight hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided the usual
rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section is to be applied
retroactively to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, no later than ninety days after the
effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that
must be adopted immediately in order to:
a. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
b. Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
c. Meet a deadline for the adoption of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 17
d. Protect public health and safety.
13. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a
previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors
in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the
commission's website. The revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty
days after posting. The revision may be challenged if the revision results in a material change
to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the commission before the end
of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.
If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the
commission.
14. A member state's rulemaking requirements do not apply under this compact.
ARTICLE XIII - OVERSIGHT ,
DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1. Oversight.
a. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall
effectuate this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the
compact.
b. Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings
by or against the commission must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction where
the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and
jurisdictional defenses to the extent the commission adopts or consents to participate in
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. This article may not affect or limit the selection
or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
misconduct, or any similar matter.
c. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in the
proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process
renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or adopted rules.
2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.
a. If the commission determines a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the adopted rules, the commission
shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the
default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action the commission
may take, and must offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
b. The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all
rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be
given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting
state's legislature, the defaulting state's state licensing authority, and each of the member
states' state licensing authority.

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 18
5. A state that has its membership terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations extending
beyond the effective date of termination.
6. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state immediately shall
provide notice to all licensees within that state of the termination. The terminated state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted under this compact for a minimum of six months
after the date of the notice of termination.
7. The commission may not incur any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
commission and the defaulting state.
8. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States
district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission's principal
office is located. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including
reasonable attorney's fees.
9. Dispute resolution.
a. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
related to the compact which arise among member states and between member and
nonmember states.
b. The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
resolution for disputes as appropriate.
10. Enforcement.
a. By majority vote as provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action against a
member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the commission's principal office is located to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules. The relief sought
may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the
prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable
attorney's fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the
commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal
law or the defaulting member state's law.
b. A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States
district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission's
principal office is located to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
adopted rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If
judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the
litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
c. Only a member state may enforce this compact against the commission.
ARTICLE XIV - EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
1. The compact is effective on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the
seventh member state.
a. On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review
the enactment of each of the first seven member states, known as the charter member
states, to determine if the statute enacted by each charter member state is materially
different than the model compact statute.

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 19
(1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
model compact statute is entitled to the default process in accordance with
article XIII .
(2) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws
from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall
remain in effect even if the number of member states is fewer than seven.
b. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member
states are subject to the process provided in subdivision u of subsection 3 of article X to
determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and
whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
c. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of
the administration of the compact before the effective date of the compact or the
commission coming into existence must be considered to be actions of the commission
unless specifically repudiated by the commission.
d. Any state that joins the compact after the commission's initial adoption of the rules and
bylaws is subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date the compact becomes
law in that state. Any rule that has been adopted previously by the commission has the
full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
2. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
compact.
a. A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until one hundred eighty days after
enactment of the repealing statute.
b. Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing
authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of
this compact before the effective date of withdrawal.
c. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state immediately shall
provide notice of the withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any
subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, the withdrawing state shall continue to
recognize all licenses granted under this compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty
days after the date of the notice of withdrawal.
3. This compact may not be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other
cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
conflict with the provisions of this compact.
4. This compact may be amended by the member states. An amendment to this compact may
not become effective and binding upon any member state until the amendment is enacted into
the laws of all member states.
ARTICLE XV - CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
effectuate the purpose, and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions
of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules may not be construed
to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
2. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of
any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be

H. B. NO. 1035 - PAGE 20
unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this
compact and the applicability of the compact to any other government, agency, person, or
circumstance may not be affected thereby.
3. Notwithstanding subsection 2, the commission may deny a state's participation in the compac t
or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 2 of article XIII, terminate a member
state's participation in the compact, if the commission determines a constitutional requirement
of a member state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact is held to be
contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact must remain in full force and
effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state
affected as to all severable matters.
ARTICLE XVI - CONSISTENT EFFECT
AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS

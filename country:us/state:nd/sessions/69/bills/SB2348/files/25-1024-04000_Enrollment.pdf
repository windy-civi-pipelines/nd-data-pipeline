AN ACT to create and enact a new section to chapter 15-10 and a new chapter to title 50 of the North

institution of higher education and health care sharing ministries' exemptions from insurance
laws and regulations.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
SECTION 1. A new section to chapter 15-10 of the North Dakota Century Code is created and
enacted as follows:
Institutions of higher education - Acceptance of health care sharing ministries as health care
coverage.
1. A student's active participation in a health care sharing ministry, as defined under section 2 o f
this Act, satisfies any requirement that a student enrolled in an institution of higher education
maintain health care coverage, except as provided in subsection 2 .
2. Notwithstanding subsection 1, this section does not apply to an international student who is
required to maintain health insurance coverage in compliance with federal visa regulations,
including students holding J, F, or M visas. Institutions of higher education shall require these
students to obtain a health insurance policy that meets the minimum standards provided by
the United States department of state and a state board of higher education policy governing
health insurance requirements for international students.

3. Acts as a facilitator among participants who have financial or medical needs to assist
participants with financial or medical needs according to criteria established by the health care

the previous month according to criteria established by the health care sharing ministry;

7. Provides a written disclaimer on or accompanying all applications and guideline materials
distributed by or on behalf of the organization which explains:
a. The organization facilitating the sharing of medical expenses is not an insurance
company and its guidelines and plan of operation are not an insurance policy;
b. Whether anyone chooses to assist the participant with medical bills is voluntary;
c. Participation in the organization or a subscription to its documents is not insurance; and
d. Regardless of whether the participant receives payments or the organization continues to
operate, the participant is responsible for the payment of the participant's medical bills.
Health care sharing ministry.
A health care sharing ministry may not be considered to be engaging in the business of insurance
and is exempt from regulations applicable to insurance entities.

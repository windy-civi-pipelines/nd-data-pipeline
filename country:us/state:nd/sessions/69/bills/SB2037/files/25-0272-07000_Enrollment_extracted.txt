warrants issued for a violation of this section to the county sheriff, who shall enter all such
warrants into the national crime information center wanted person file. A court may not relieve
an individual, other than a juvenile, who violates this section from serving a term of at least

are on supervised probation. The department, in a timely manner, shall provide the
attorney general any information, including the offender's level of risk and supporting
documentation, concerning individuals required to be registered under this section who
are about to be released or placed into the community.
b. The attorney general shall conduct a risk assessment of sexual offenders who are not

c. The juvenile courts or the agency having legal custody of a juvenile shall conduct a risk
assessment of juvenile sexual offenders who are required to register under this section.

not reside within five hundred feet [152.4 meters] of a public or nonpublic preschool or
elementary, middle, or high school.

public by a law enforcement agency if the individual is a moderate or high risk and the agency
determines that disclosure of the conviction and registration information is necessary for public
protection. The attorney general shall develop guidelines for public disclosure of offender
registration information. Public disclosure may include internet access if the offender:
a. Is required to register for a lifetime under subsection 8;
b. Has been determined to be a high risk to the public by the department, the attorney
general, or the courts, according to guidelines developed by those agencies; or
c. Has been determined to be a high risk to the public by an agency of another state or the
federal government.
If the offender has been determined to be a moderate risk, public disclosure must include, at a
minimum, notification of the offense to the victim registered under chapter 12.1-34 and to any
agency, civic organization, or group of persons who have characteristics similar to those of a
victim of the offender. Upon request, law enforcement agencies may release conviction and
registration information regarding low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk offenders.
15. A state officer, law enforcement agency, or public school district or governing body of a
nonpublic school or any appointee, officer, or employee of those entities is not subject to civil
or criminal liability for making risk determinations, allowing a sexual offender to attend a
school function under section 12.1-20-25, or for disclosing or for failing to disclose information
as permitted by this section.
16. If a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent and required or ordered to register as a sexual offender
or as an offender against a child under this section, the juvenile shall comply with the
registration requirements in this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a law
enforcement agency shall register a juvenile offender in the same manner as adult offenders
and may release any relevant and necessary information on file to other law enforcement
agencies, the department of health and human services, or the public if disclosure is
necessary to protect public health or safety. The law enforcement agency shall release any
relevant and necessary information on file to the superintendent or principal of the school the
juvenile attends. The school administration shall notify others in similar positions if the juvenile
transfers to another learning institution in or outside the state.
17. If an individual has been required to register as a sexual offender or an offender against a
child under section 12.1-32-15 or former section 27-20-52.1 before August 1, 1999, the
individual may petition the court to be removed from the offender list if registration is no longer
mandatory for that individual. In considering the petition, the court shall comply with the
requirements of this section.
18. A sexual offender who is currently assigned a moderate or high-risk level by the attorney
general may not use a state park of this state as a residence or residential address to comply
with the registration requirements of this section. Before arriving at a state park for overnight

S. B. NO. 2037 - PAGE 10
lodging or camping, a sexual offender who is assigned a moderate or high-risk level by the
attorney general shall notify a parks and recreation department law enforcement officer at the
state park where the sexual offender will be staying.
19. When an individual who is required to register pursuant to this section plans to travel outside
of the United States, at least twenty-one days before the intended travel, the individual shall

Introduced by
Senators Mathern, Kessel, Patten
Representatives Frelich, J. Olson
1 A BILL for an Act to provide an appropriation to the legislative council for the purpose of
2 contracting with a consultant to study the feasibility and desirability of creating a regenerative
3 grazing ranch in the state; and to provide for a legislative management study.
4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
5 SECTION 1. APPROPRIATION - LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL - CONSULTANTS FOR
6 INTERIM STUDY - ONE-TIME FUNDING.
7 There is appropriated out of any moneys in the general fund in the state treasury, not
8 otherwise appropriated, the sum of $49,500, or so much of the sum as may be necessary, to the
9 legislative council for the purpose of contracting with a consultant to study the feasibility and
10 desirability of creating a regenerative grazing ranch in the state, for the biennium beginning
11 July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2027. The funding provided in this section is considered a
12 one-time funding item.
13 SECTION 2. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - REGENERATIVE GRAZING
14 PRACTICES.
15 1. During the 2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall study the feasibility and
16 desirability of recognizing rangeland ecosystems as a sink for atmospheric carbon
17 dioxide and researching the role of regenerative grazing practices on carbon fluxes
18 within the state. The study must:
19 a. Collect scientific data necessary to understand regenerative grazing effects on
20 atmospheric carbon dioxide fluxes, rangeland productivity, and other ecosystem
21 services;
22 b. Determine a platform for ranchers and stakeholders to connect and learn how
23 regenerative grazing practices alter carbon and water fluxes with a working cattle
24 herd and how this data could improve ranching sustainability;

Legislative Assembly
1 c. Determine whether establishing a regenerative grazing ranch, which would be
2 known as grand ranch and would function similar to grand sky and grand farm,
3 would bolster the energy and ranching industries of the state;
4 d. Identify sustainable rangeland carbon management practices and funding
5 sources and organizations interested in working with ranchers and stakeholders;
6 e. Implement grazing management as part of the carbon solution relating to beef
7 production and carbon yields; and

9 resources, and stakeholders from the ranching and energy industries of the state.
10 2. The legislative management shall report its findings and recommendations, together
11 with any legislation required to implement the recommendations, to the seventieth
12 legislative assembly.

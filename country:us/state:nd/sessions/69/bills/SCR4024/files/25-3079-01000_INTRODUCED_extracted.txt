1 A concurrent resolution directing the Legislative Management to consider studying using

3 WHEREAS, the Capitol building fund was created at statehood through a grant of 50,000
4 acres of land to the state for the purpose of financing construction of public buildings for

6 fund to allow the fund to be used for construction, renovation, and other improvements of public

8 WHEREAS, the 1967 Legislative Assembly considered the need to improve legislative
9 committee rooms and provide office space for committee chairmen, legislative study lounges,
10 and Legislative Council offices; and
11 WHEREAS, the 1967 Legislative Assembly adopted legislation directing the Capitol
12 building fund be dedicated and reserved for the exclusive purpose of the construction of an
13 addition to the legislative wing; and
14 WHEREAS, since 1967, money in the Capitol building fund has been used for a variety of
15 purposes including the payment of special assessments and the construction and maintenance
16 of the Governor's residence; and
17 WHEREAS, a significant portion of the land granted to the state and the assets of the fund
18 continue to contribute to the balance of the Capitol building fund, which is in excess of
19 $5,000,000, despite appropriations from the fund for other purposes totaling nearly $13,000,000
20 over the last 3 bienniums; and
21 WHEREAS, many legislative meeting rooms are too small to accommodate the public, lack
22 secondary or emergency exits, and are not designed to function with today's technology; and
23 WHEREAS, the legislative parking lot frequently is in need of repair, and during legislative
24 sessions often is covered with snow and ice causing unsafe conditions; and

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, our Capitol is one of the few in the country in which legislators have no
2 dedicated place to work or private space to meet with constituents; and
3 WHEREAS, long-term Capitol facility plans have explored the option of building a parking
4 structure on the west side of the legislative wing rather than continuing to repair the legislative
5 parking lot; and
6 WHEREAS, construction of a parking structure also would present an opportunity to
7 include above the parking structure space for modern committee rooms, legislative offices and
8 meeting space, and office space for legislative staff; and
9 WHEREAS, construction of a legislative office building would allow executive branch
10 agencies that are leasing office space off the Capitol grounds to move into the Capitol, saving
11 money on leased space and providing greater access to the public; and
12 WHEREAS, as the Capitol approaches its 100th anniversary, it is vital for the Legislative
13 Assembly to address the future needs of the legislative branch and provide future legislators
14 with the tools necessary to retain the Legislative Assembly's constitutional role as a coequal
15 branch of government;
16 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF NORTH DAKOTA, THE
17 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN:
18 That the Legislative Management consider studying using dedicated funds in the Capitol
19 building fund to build a legislative office building; and
20 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislative Management report its finding and
21 recommendations, together with any legislation required to implement the recommendations to
22 the Seventieth Legislative Assembly.

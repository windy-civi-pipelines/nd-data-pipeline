5 SECTION 1. A new section to chapter 57-15 of the North Dakota Century Code is created
6 and enacted as follows:
7 Limitation on levies by taxing districts without voter approval.
8 1. a. Notwithstanding that a taxing district may have unused or excess levy authority
9 under any other provision of law, this section supersedes and limits that authority.
10 This section may not be interpreted as authority to increase any property tax levy
11 authority otherwise provided by law and must be applied to limit any property tax
12 levy authority to which a taxing district may otherwise be entitled. Property taxes
13 levied in dollars by a taxing district may not exceed the amount the taxing district
14 levied in dollars in the preceding taxable year by more than the consumer price
15 index, but not to exceed three percent, except:
16 (1) When property and improvements to property which were not taxable in the
17 preceding taxable year are taxable in the current year, the amount levied in
18 dollars in the preceding taxable year by the taxing district must be increased
19 for purposes of this section to reflect the taxes that would have been
20 imposed against the additional taxable valuation attributable to that property
21 at the mill rate applied to all property in the preceding taxable year.
22 (2) When a property tax exemption existed in the preceding taxable year which
23 has been reduced or no longer exists for the current taxable year, the
24 amount levied in dollars in the preceding taxable year by the taxing district

6 for the current taxable year, the amount levied in dollars in the preceding
7 taxable year by the taxing district must be reduced for purposes of this
8 section by the amount of taxes that were imposed against the taxable
9 valuation of that property in the preceding taxable year.
10 (4) When a temporary mill levy increase, excluding an increase under this
11 section, authorized by the electors of the taxing district or mill levy
12 imposition authority under state law existed in the preceding taxable year
13 but is no longer applicable or has been reduced, the amount levied in
14 dollars in the preceding taxable year by the taxing district must be adjusted
15 to reflect the expired temporary mill levy increase and the eliminated or
16 reduced mill levy under state law before the percentage increase allowable
17 under this subsection is applied.
18 b. If the actual percentage increase in property taxes levied in dollars by a taxing
19 district compared to the property taxes levied in the preceding taxable year is
20 less than the percentage increase limitation under subdivision a, the taxing
21 district may carry forward the excess percentage increase to any of the three
22 succeeding taxable years up to a combined total of an amount equal to double
23 the percentage increase limitation under subdivision a in any one taxable year .
24 The taxing district may not accumulate unused excess percentage increases

26 increase must be used in the order it was accumulated. Excess percentage
27 increases may not be used to increase the percentage increase limitation under
28 subdivision a more than once .

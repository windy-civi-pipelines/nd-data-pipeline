9 11. "Compensable injury" means an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of
10 hazardous employment which must be established by medical evidence supported by
11 objective medical findings.
12 a. The term includes:
13 (1) Disease caused by a hazard to which an employee is subjected in the

18 (3) Injuries due to heart attack or other heart-related disease, stroke, and
19 physical injury caused by mental stimulus, but only when caused by the
20 employee's employment with reasonable medical certainty, and only when it
21 is determined with reasonable medical certainty that unusual stress is at
22 least fifty percent of the cause of the injury or disease as compared with all
23 other contributing causes combined. Unusual stress means stress greater
Page No. 1 25.0544.02000

Legislative Assembly
1 than the highest level of stress normally experienced or anticipated in that
2 position or line of work.
3 (4) Injuries arising out of employer-required or supplied travel to and from a
4 remote jobsite or activities performed at the direction or under the control of
5 the employer.
6 (5) An injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an

8 (6) A mental or psychological condition caused by a physical injury, but only
9 when the physical injury is determined with reasonable medical certainty to
10 be at least fifty percent of the cause of the condition as compared with all
11 other contributing causes combined, and only when the condition did not
12 pre-exist the work injury.
13 (7) Posttraumatic stress disorder, if the injured employee establishes by a
14 preponderance of the evidence that the condition causing the posttraumatic
15 stress disorder was extraordinary, based on unusual stress of a greater
16 dimension than the day-to-day emotional strain and tension experienced by
17 similarly situated employees.
18 (a) The mental injury must be:
19 [1] Diagnosed by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist;
20 [2] Meet the criteria established in the "Diagnostic and Statistical
21 Manual of Mental Disorders", American psychiatric association,
22 (5th edition, text revision 2022) ;
23 [3] Determined not to pre - exist the employment event; and
24 [4] Determined with reasonable medical certainty to be at least fifty
25 percent of the cause as compared to all other contributing
26 causes combined.
27 (b) The mental injury may not be the result of any of the following actions
28 taken in good faith by an employer:
29 [1] A disciplinary action;
30 [2] A work evaluation;
31 [3] A job transfer;
Page No. 2 25.0544.02000

1 [4] A layoff;
2 [5] A demotion; or
3 [6] A termination.
4 b. The term does not include:

7 organization may pay for preventive treatment for an exposure to a
8 bloodborne pathogen as defined in section 23-07.5-01 occurring in the
9 course of employment and for exposure to rabies occurring in the course of
10 employment.
11 (2) A willfully self-inflicted injury, including suicide or attempted suicide, or an
12 injury caused by the employee's willful intention to injure or kill another.
13 (3) Any injury caused by the use of intoxicants, including recreational marijuana
14 use, or the illegal use of controlled substances.
15 (4) An injury that arises out of an altercation in which the injured employee is an
16 aggressor. This paragraph does not apply to public safety employees,
17 including law enforcement officers or private security personnel who are
18 required to engage in altercations as part of their job duties if the altercation
19 arises out of the performance of those job duties.
20 (5) An injury that arises out of an illegal act committed by the injured employee.
21 (6) An injury that arises out of an employee's voluntary nonpaid participation in
22 any recreational activity, including athletic events, parties, and picnics, even
23 though the employer pays some or all of the cost of the activity.
24 (7) Injuries attributable to a pre-existing injury, disease, or other condition,
25 including when the employment acts as a trigger to produce symptoms in
26 the pre-existing injury, disease, or other condition unless the employment

28 severity. Pain is a symptom and may be considered in determining whether
29 there is a substantial acceleration or substantial worsening of a pre-existing
30 injury, disease, or other condition, but pain alone is not a substantial
31 acceleration or a substantial worsening.
Page No. 3 25.0544.02000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 (8) A nonemployment injury that, although acting upon a prior compensable
2 injury, is an independent intervening cause of injury.
3 (9) A latent or asymptomatic degenerative condition, caused in substantial part
4 by employment duties, which is triggered or made active by a subsequent
5 injury.
6 (10) A Except as otherwise provided in subdivision a, a mental injury arising from
7 mental stimulus.

24 other contributing causes combined. Unusual stress means stress greater
25 than the highest level of stress normally experienced or anticipated in that
26 position or line of work.

28 remote jobsite or activities performed at the direction or under the control of

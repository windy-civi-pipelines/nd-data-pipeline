Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4021
of North Dakota
Introduced by
Senator Gerhardt
1 A concurrent resolution urging the United States Federal Government, Congress, and the
2 Governor of North Dakota to end the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
3 WHEREAS, the President Donald J. Trump issued executive orders directing federal
4 agencies to align with the administration's policy to terminate diversity, equity, and inclusion
5 initiatives (DEI); and
6 WHEREAS, the orders directed that employment, procurement, and contracting practices of
7 federal contractors and subcontractors may not consider race or gender and further required
8 every federal contract or award to certify the recipient does not operate any programs
9 promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion which violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination
10 laws; and
11 WHEREAS, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been tasked with
12 identifying inefficiencies within the federal government; and
13 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation and the North Dakota
14 Department of Transportation administer the disadvantaged business enterprise program; and
15 WHEREAS, the disadvantaged business enterprise program (DBE) is a form of DEI; and
16 WHEREAS, the DBE program requirements are burdensome and often a deterrent for
17 contractors to bid federally funded projects; the requirements increase contractors' overhead
18 costs, reduce competitive bidding, and prevent general contractors from offering the lowest
19 possible bid, thus wasting taxpayer funds; and
20 WHEREAS, the increased costs due to the DBE program are not needed, do not add value,
21 and do not serve the taxpayer; and
22 WHEREAS, government construction contracts should be awarded based on the lowest
23 responsible bid, not based on the color of someone's skin, race, sex, or any other presumption
24 of social disadvantage; and

7 Century Code is amended and reenacted as follows:
8 1. A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon income earned or received in that
9 taxable year by every resident and nonresident individual, estate, and trust. A taxpayer
10 computing the tax under this section is only eligible for those adjustments or credits
11 that are specifically provided for in this section. Provided, that for purposes of this
12 section, any person required to file a state income tax return under this chapter, but
13 who has not computed a federal taxable income figure, shall compute a federal
14 taxable income figure using a pro forma return in order to determine a federal taxable
15 income figure to be used as a starting point in computing state income tax under this
16 section. The tax for individuals is equal to North Dakota taxable income multiplied by
17 the rates in the applicable rate schedule in subdivisions a through dc corresponding to
18 an individual's filing status used for federal income tax purposes. For an estate or
19 trust, the schedule in subdivision ed must be used for purposes of this subsection.
20 a. Single, other than head of household or surviving spouse, and married filing

10 f.e. For an individual who is not a resident of this state for the entire year, or for a
11 nonresident estate or trust, the tax is equal to the tax otherwise computed under
12 this subsection multiplied by a fraction in which:
13 (1) The numerator is the federal adjusted gross income allocable and
14 apportionable to this state; and
15 (2) The denominator is the federal adjusted gross income from all sources
16 reduced by the net income from the amounts specified in subdivisions a and
17 b of subsection 2.
18 In the case of married individuals filing a joint return, if one spouse is a resident
19 of this state for the entire year and the other spouse is a nonresident for part or
20 all of the tax year, the tax on the joint return must be computed under this
21 subdivision.
22 g.f. The tax commissioner shall prescribe new rate schedules that apply in lieu of the
23 schedules set forth in subdivisions a through ed. The new schedules must be
24 determined by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each
25 income bracket for which a tax is imposed by the cost-of-living adjustment for the
26 taxable year as determined by the secretary of the United States treasury for
27 purposes of section 1(f) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
28 amended. For this purpose, the rate applicable to each income bracket may not
29 be changed, and the manner of applying the cost-of-living adjustment must be
30 the same as that used for adjusting the income brackets for federal income tax
31 purposes.

3. In determining the assessed value of real and personal property, except agricultural property,

serve as a basis of taxation, nor may the assessor adopt as a criterion of value the price at
which said property would sell at auction, or at forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the
property in the town or district, but the assessor shall value each article or description by itself,
and at such sum or price as the assessor believes the same to be fairly worth in money. In
assessing any tract or lot of real property, there must be determined the value of the land,
exclusive of improvements, and the value of all taxable improvements and structures thereon,
and the aggregate value of the property, including all taxable structures and other
improvements, excluding the value of crops growing upon cultivated lands. In valuing any real
property upon which there is a coal or other mine, or stone or other quarry, the same must be
valued at such a price as such property, including the mine or quarry, would sell for at a fair
voluntary sale for cash. Agricultural lands within the corporate limits of a city which are not
platted constitute agricultural property and must be so classified and valued for ad valorem
property tax purposes until such lands are put to another use. Agricultural lands, whether
within the corporate limits of a city or not, which were platted and assessed as agricultural
property prior to March 30, 1981, must be assessed as agricultural property for ad valorem
property tax purposes until put to another use. Such valuation must be uniform with the
valuation of adjoining unannexed agricultural land.

term "true and full value" has the same meaning as provided in subsection 15 of section

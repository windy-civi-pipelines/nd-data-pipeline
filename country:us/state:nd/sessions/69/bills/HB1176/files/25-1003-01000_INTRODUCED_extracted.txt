2 personally or by a representative before the board or by mail or other
3 communication to the board, in which the owner's reasons for asking for the
4 reduction are made known to the board. The proceedings of the board shall show
5 the manner in which the appeal was made known to the board and the reasons
6 for granting any reduction in any such assessment.
7 b. The county board of equalization after notice to the local board of equalization
8 may increase the assessment on any separate piece or parcel of real property
9 even though such property was assessed in a city or township having a local
10 board of equalization. The county board of equalization may not increase the
11 valuation returned by the assessor or the local board of equalization to an
12 amount that results in a cumulative increase of more than fifteen percent from the
13 amount of the previous year's assessment without giving the owner or the
14 owner's agent notice by mail to the owner of the property that such person may
15 appear before the board on the date designated in the notice, which date must be
16 at least five days after the mailing of the notice. The county auditor as clerk of the

24 3. The owner of any separate piece or parcel of real estate that has been assessed may
25 appeal the assessment thereon to the state board of equalization as provided in

27 assessment to the local equalization board of the taxing district in which the property
28 was assessed and to the county board of equalization of the county in which the
29 property was assessed. Notwithstanding this requirement, an owner of property which
30 has been subjected to a new assessment authorized under section 57-14-08 may

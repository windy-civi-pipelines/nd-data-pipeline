8 of loss, itemize the total dollar amounts of restitution claimed, and present facts and
9 evidence sufficient to support a finding the restitution is directly related to the offense
10 and the amount awarded. The prosecutor shall serve the defendant with a copy of the
11 information submitted by the victim no later than sixty days following sentencing.
12 3. The defendant may challenge restitution but must do so by requesting a hearing within
13 thirty days of being served with the written notification of the amount of restitution
14 requested. The hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the court. If no
15 hearing is requested, the court may enter a judgment ordering restitution. A defendant
16 may not challenge restitution after the thirty-day time period has passed.

18 reasonable damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which
19 damages are limited to those directly related to the criminal offense and expenses
20 actually sustained as a direct result of the defendant's criminal action. This can include
21 an amount equal to the cost of necessary and related professional services and
22 devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care. The defendant may

24 treatment costs for a victim of a sexual offense as defined in chapters 12.1-20 and

26 manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established
27 pursuant to this subsection. The court may order the defendant to disclose income and
28 assets on forms developed by the state court administrator to facilitate the setting of
29 an appropriate payment plan. The court shall order restitution be paid to the division of
30 adult services for any benefits the division has paid or may pay to the victim under
31 chapter 54-23.4 unless the court, on the record, directs otherwise. Any payments

1 made pursuant to the order must be deducted from damages awarded in a civil action
2 arising from the same incident.
3 5. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of
4 probation, unless the court directs otherwise, may be filed without filing fee,
5 transcribed, and enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by
6 the division of adult services in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the
7 courts of this state may be enforced. Upon thirty days' written notice to the victim's last
8 known address, the court may order the judgment imposing a duty to pay restitution or
9 reparation be docketed in the same manner as a civil judgment under section
10 29-26-22.1.
11 6. When the restitution ordered by the court under subsection 1 is the result of a finding
12 that the defendant issued a check or draft without sufficient funds or without an
13 account, the court shall impose as costs the greater of the sum of ten dollars or an
14 amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs
15 imposed under this subsection, however, may not exceed one thousand dollars. The
16 state-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
17 this subsection to the state treasurer for deposit in the restitution collection assistance
18 fund. The funds deposited into the restitution collection assistance fund are
19 appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for the purpose of defraying
20 expenses incident to the collection of restitution, including operating expenses and the
21 compensation of additional necessary personnel. The state's attorneys and
22 county-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
23 this subsection to the county treasurer to be deposited in the county general fund.
24 7. The court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work as a
25 condition of probation, which assigned work need not be related to the offense
26 charged, but must not be solely for the benefit of a private individual other than the
27 victim.
28 8. Under section 12.1-32-07, the court may order that the defendant reimburse indigent
29 defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation.
30 a. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to
31 pay attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 any order or amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment
2 proceeding, shall notify the defendant, the defendant's probation officer, and the
3 prosecuting attorney of the presumed amount of costs and expenses to be
4 reimbursed, as determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents, and
5 of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. The reimbursement
6 amount must include an application fee imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the
7 fee has not been paid before disposition of the case and the court has not waived
8 payment of the fee.
9 b. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving
10 notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the
11 actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be shown. In determining

13 resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that reimbursement of
14 costs and expenses will impose.

16 as a condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that
17 reimbursement may at any time petition the court that imposed the condition to
18 waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the costs and expenses. If the court
19 is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on
20 the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive
21 reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of
22 payment.
23 d. If at any time the court finds that the defendant is able to reimburse costs and
24 expenses and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or
25 enlarge the conditions of probation or revoke probation as provided in
26 subsection 6 or 7, as applicable, of section 12.1-32-07.
27 9. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay a fine, supervision fee,
28 reimbursement for indigent defense costs and expenses, or restitution or reparations,
29 the court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of all or
30 part of a fine, a supervision fee, reimbursement for indigent defense costs and
31 expenses, or restitution or reparations. The defendant may not perform reasonable

22 defense services. For an application for indigent defense services in the district court, a
23 nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid at the time the application is

6 collection action.

3 corrections and rehabilitation or other responsible party. In all other cases, the court
4 may place the defendant under the supervision and management of a community

12 probation that the defendant not commit another offense during the period for which
13 the probation remains subject to revocation. The court shall order supervision costs
14 and fees of not less than fifty-five dollars per month unless the court makes a specific
15 finding on record that the imposition of fees will result in an undue hardship. If the
16 offender has not paid the full amount of supervision fees and costs before completion
17 or termination of probation, the court may issue an order, after opportunity for hearing,
18 to determine the amount of supervision fees and costs that are unpaid. The order may
19 be filed, transcribed, and enforced by the department of corrections and rehabilitation
20 in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by a district court of this stateThe
21 department of corrections and rehabilitation may administer a risk assessment for the
22 evaluation of each defendant when placed under the supervision and management of
23 the department of corrections and rehabilitation. The results of the risk assessment
24 may be used to set a level of supervision and management and develop an
25 individualized case plan for the defendant. The case plan may include a list of
26 responsivity factors and a plan to address any risk factors identified in the risk
27 assessment.
28 3. The court shall provide as an explicit condition of every probation that the defendant
29 may not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon while the
30 defendant is on probation. Except when the offense is a misdemeanor offense under
31 section 12.1-17-01, 12.1-17-01.1, 12.1-17-01.2, 12.1-17-05, or 12.1-17-07.1, or

2 pled guilty to, or has been found guilty of, a misdemeanor or infraction offense, the

4 specific finding on the record before imposition of a sentence or a probation that there
5 is good cause to waive the condition. The court may not waive this condition of
6 probation if the court places the defendant under the supervision and management of
7 the department of corrections and rehabilitation. The court shall provide as an explicit
8 condition of probation that the defendant may not willfully defraud a urine test
9 administered as a condition of probation. Unless waived on the record by the court,
10 the court shall also provide as a condition of probation that the defendant undergo
11 various agreed-to community constraints and conditions as intermediate measures of

24 12.1-32-08. Hearing prior to ordering restitution, reparation, or reimbursement of
25 indigent defense costs and expenses - Conditions - Collection of restitution for
26 insufficient funds checks - Continuing appropriation.
27 1. The court, when sentencing a person adjudged guilty of criminal activities that have
28 resulted in pecuniary damages, in addition to any other sentence the court may
29 impose, shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim or other recipient
30 as determined by the court. Restitution must include payment to the owner of real
31 property that is contaminated by the defendant in the manufacturing of
Page No. 13 25.1150.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 methamphetamine for the cost of removing the contamination and returning the
2 property to the property's condition before contamination and to any other person that
3 has incurred costs in decontaminating the property.
4 2. If the court has retained jurisdiction after the sentencing hearing for claims of
5 restitution, to make a claim for restitution, the victim shall submit information by
6 affidavit or declaration and, as applicable, documentary evidence within the time
7 specified in the order. The information submitted must describe the items or elements
8 of loss, itemize the total dollar amounts of restitution claimed, and present facts and
9 evidence sufficient to support a finding the restitution is directly related to the offense
10 and the amount awarded. The prosecutor shall serve the defendant with a copy of the
11 information submitted by the victim no later than sixty days following sentencing.
12 3. The defendant may challenge restitution but must do so by requesting a hearing within
13 thirty days of being served with the written notification of the amount of restitution
14 requested. The hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the court. If no
15 hearing is requested, the court may enter a judgment ordering restitution. A defendant
16 may not challenge restitution after the thirty-day time period has passed.
17 4. In determining the amount of restitution, the court shall take into account the
18 reasonable damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which
19 damages are limited to those directly related to the criminal offense and expenses
20 actually sustained as a direct result of the defendant's criminal action. This can include
21 an amount equal to the cost of necessary and related professional services and
22 devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care. The defendant may
23 be required as part of the sentence imposed by the court to pay the prescribed
24 treatment costs for a victim of a sexual offense as defined in chapters 12.1-20 and
25 12.1-27.2. The court shall fix the amount of restitution or reparation and shall fix the
26 manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established
27 pursuant to this subsection. The court may order the defendant to disclose income and
28 assets on forms developed by the state court administrator to facilitate the setting of
29 an appropriate payment plan. The court shall order restitution be paid to the division of
30 adult services for any benefits the division has paid or may pay to the victim under
31 chapter 54-23.4 unless the court, on the record, directs otherwise. Any payments
Page No. 14 25.1150.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 made pursuant to the order must be deducted from damages awarded in a civil action
2 arising from the same incident.
3 5. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of
4 probation, unless the court directs otherwise, may be filed without filing fee,
5 transcribed, and enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by
6 the division of adult services in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the
7 courts of this state may be enforced. Upon thirty days' written notice to the victim's last
8 known address, the court may order the judgment imposing a duty to pay restitution or
9 reparation be docketed in the same manner as a civil judgment under section
10 29-26-22.1.
11 6. When the restitution ordered by the court under subsection 1 is the result of a finding
12 that the defendant issued a check or draft without sufficient funds or without an
13 account, the court shall impose as costs the greater of the sum of ten dollars or an
14 amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs
15 imposed under this subsection, however, may not exceed one thousand dollars. The
16 state-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
17 this subsection to the state treasurer for deposit in the restitution collection assistance
18 fund. The funds deposited into the restitution collection assistance fund are
19 appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for the purpose of defraying
20 expenses incident to the collection of restitution, including operating expenses and the
21 compensation of additional necessary personnel. The state's attorneys and
22 county-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
23 this subsection to the county treasurer to be deposited in the county general fund.
24 7. The court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work as a
25 condition of probation, which assigned work need not be related to the offense
26 charged, but must not be solely for the benefit of a private individual other than the
27 victim.
28 8. Under section 12.1-32-07, the court may order that the defendant reimburse indigent
29 defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation.
30 a. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to
31 pay attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in
Page No. 15 25.1150.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 any order or amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment
2 proceeding, shall notify the defendant, the defendant's probation officer, and the
3 prosecuting attorney of the presumed amount of costs and expenses to be
4 reimbursed, as determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents, and
5 of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. The reimbursement
6 amount must include an application fee imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the
7 fee has not been paid before disposition of the case and the court has not waived
8 payment of the fee.
9 b. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving
10 notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the
11 actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be shown. In determining

13 resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that reimbursement of
14 costs and expenses will impose.
15 c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses
16 as a condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that
17 reimbursement may at any time petition the court that imposed the condition to
18 waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the costs and expenses. If the court
19 is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on
20 the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive
21 reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of
22 payment.
23 d. If at any time the court finds that the defendant is able to reimburse costs and
24 expenses and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or
25 enlarge the conditions of probation or revoke probation as provided in
26 subsection 6 or 7, as applicable, of section 12.1-32-07.
27 9. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay a fine, supervision fee,
28 reimbursement for indigent defense costs and expenses, or restitution or reparations,
29 the court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of all or
30 part of a fine, a supervision fee, reimbursement for indigent defense costs and
31 expenses, or restitution or reparations. The defendant may not perform reasonable

17 40-18-06.2 or 40-18-15.1, in any appeal taken to district court from a judgment of conviction in
18 municipal court pursuant to section 40-18-19, and in an appeal or postconviction matter seeking
19 relief from a conviction resulting from violation of a municipal ordinance. A defendant requesting
20 representation by counsel at public expense, or for whom counsel provided at public expense

22 defense services. For an application for indigent defense services in the district court, a
23 nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid at the time the application is
24 submitted. The district court may extend the time for payment of the fee or may waive or reduce

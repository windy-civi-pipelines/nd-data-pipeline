13 information submitted by the victim no later than sixty days following sentencing.
14 3. The defendant may challenge restitution but must do so by requesting a hearing within
15 thirty days of being served with the written notification of the amount of restitution
16 requested. The hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the court. If no
17 hearing is requested, the court may enter a judgment ordering restitution. A defendant
18 may not challenge restitution after the thirty-day time period has passed.
19 4. In determining the amount of restitution, the court shall take into account the
20 reasonable damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which
21 damages are limited to those directly related to the criminal offense and expenses
22 actually sustained as a direct result of the defendant's criminal action. This can include
23 an amount equal to the cost of necessary and related professional services and
24 devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care. The defendant may
25 be required as part of the sentence imposed by the court to pay the prescribed
26 treatment costs for a victim of a sexual offense as defined in chapters 12.1-20 and
27 12.1-27.2. The court shall fix the amount of restitution or reparation and shall fix the
28 manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established
29 pursuant to this subsection. The court may order the defendant to disclose income and
30 assets on forms developed by the state court administrator to facilitate the setting of
31 an appropriate payment plan. The court shall order restitution be paid to the division of
Page No. 14 25.1150.02000

1 adult services for any benefits the division has paid or may pay to the victim under
2 chapter 54-23.4 unless the court, on the record, directs otherwise. Any payments
3 made pursuant to the order must be deducted from damages awarded in a civil action
4 arising from the same incident.
5 5. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of
6 probation, unless the court directs otherwise, may be filed without filing fee,
7 transcribed, and enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by
8 the division of adult services in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the
9 courts of this state may be enforced. Upon thirty days' written notice to the victim's last
10 known address, the court may order the judgment imposing a duty to pay restitution or
11 reparation be docketed in the same manner as a civil judgment under section
12 29-26-22.1.
13 6. When the restitution ordered by the court under subsection 1 is the result of a finding
14 that the defendant issued a check or draft without sufficient funds or without an
15 account, the court shall impose as costs the greater of the sum of ten dollars or an
16 amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs
17 imposed under this subsection, however, may not exceed one thousand dollars. The
18 state-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
19 this subsection to the state treasurer for deposit in the restitution collection assistance
20 fund. The funds deposited into the restitution collection assistance fund are
21 appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for the purpose of defraying
22 expenses incident to the collection of restitution, including operating expenses and the
23 compensation of additional necessary personnel. The state's attorneys and
24 county-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under
25 this subsection to the county treasurer to be deposited in the county general fund.
26 7. The court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work as a
27 condition of probation, which assigned work need not be related to the offense
28 charged, but must not be solely for the benefit of a private individual other than the
29 victim.
30 8. Under section 12.1-32-07, the court may order that the defendant reimburse indigent
31 defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation.

1 a. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to
2 pay attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in
3 any order or amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment
4 proceeding, shall notify the defendant, the defendant's probation officer, and the
5 prosecuting attorney of the presumed amount of costs and expenses to be
6 reimbursed, as determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents, and
7 of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. The reimbursement
8 amount must include an application fee imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the
9 fee has not been paid before disposition of the case and the court has not waived
10 payment of the fee.
11 b. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving
12 notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the
13 actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be shown. In determining
14 the amount and method of reimbursement, the court shall consider the financial
15 resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that reimbursement of
16 costs and expenses will impose.
17 c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses
18 as a condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that
19 reimbursement may at any time petition the court that imposed the condition to
20 waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the costs and expenses. If the court
21 is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on
22 the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive
23 reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of
24 payment.
25 d. If at any time the court finds that the defendant is able to reimburse costs and
26 expenses and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or
27 enlarge the conditions of probation or revoke probation as provided in
28 subsection 6 or 7, as applicable, of section 12.1-32-07.
29 9. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay a fine, supervision fee,
30 reimbursement for indigent defense costs and expenses, or restitution or reparations,
31 the court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of all or

1 part of a fine, a supervision fee, reimbursement for indigent defense costs and
2 expenses, or restitution or reparations. The defendant may not perform reasonable
3 assigned work in lieu of restitution or reparations unless the person entitled to
4 restitution or reparations has consented in writing or on the record.

10 1. Lawyers provided to represent indigent persons must be compensated at a

14 approved by the commission, must be paid by the state. Expenses necessary for the
15 adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted for violation of a home rule
16 county's ordinance must be paid by the home rule county. Expenses necessary for the
17 adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in municipal court, when approved
18 by the judge, must be paid by the city in which the alleged offense took place. The city
19 shall also pay the expenses in any matter transferred to district court pursuant to
20 section 40-18-06.2 or 40-18-15.1, in any appeal taken to district court from a judgment
21 of conviction in municipal court pursuant to section 40-18-19, and in an appeal or
22 postconviction matter seeking relief from a conviction resulting from violation of a
23 municipal ordinance. A defendant requesting representation by counsel at public
24 expense, or for whom counsel provided at public expense without a request is
25 considered appropriate by the court, shall submit an application for indigent defense
26 services. For an application for indigent defense services in the district court, a
27 nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid at the time the
28 application is submitted. The district court may extend the time for payment of the fee
29 or may waive or reduce the fee if the court determines the defendant is financially
30 unable to pay all or part of the fee. If the application fee is not paid before disposition
31 of the case, the fee amount must be added to the amount to be reimbursed under this

5 state, home rule county, or city expends on the defendant's behalf.
6 a. At the time counsel is provided for a defendant, the court shall advise the
7 defendant of the defendant's potential obligation to reimburse the appropriate
8 governmental entity the amounts expended on behalf of the defendant.
9 b. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to
10 pay attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in
11 any order or amended judgment entered following a revocation or other
12 postjudgment proceeding, shall order the defendant to reimburse the presumed
13 amount of indigent defense costs and expenses, as determined by the
14 commission, and shall notify the defendant of the right to a hearing on the
15 reimbursement amount. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within
16 thirty days of receiving notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a
17 hearing at which the actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be
18 shown. In determining the amount of reimbursement and method of payment, the
19 court shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the
20 burden that reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.
21 c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses
22 and who is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any time petition
23 the court to waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the attorney's fees and
24 expenses. If the court is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will
25 impose undue hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family,
26 the court may waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or
27 modify the method of payment.
28 3. The attorney general, the state's attorney of the home rule county, or the prosecuting
29 attorney of the city in which the alleged offense took place, if reimbursement has not
30 been received, shall seek civil recovery of any amounts expended on the defendant's
31 behalf anytime the attorney general, state's attorney, or city attorney determines the

1 person for whom counsel was appointed may have funds to repay the state, home rule
2 county, or city within six years of the date such amount was paid on that person's
3 behalf. A person against whom civil recovery is sought under this subsection is entitled
4 to all exemptions accorded to other judgment debtors. The attorney general, state's
5 attorney, or prosecuting attorney may contract with a private sector collection agency
6 for assistance in seeking recovery of such funds. Before referring the matter to a
7 collection agency, the state's attorney shall notify the person who is the subject of the
8 collection action.
9 4. The indigent defense administration fund is a special fund in the state treasury. The
10 state treasurer shall deposit in the fund all application fees collected under
11 subsection 1. All moneys in the indigent defense administration fund are appropriated
12 on a continuing basis to the commission on legal counsel for indigents to be used in
13 the administration of the indigent defense system.
14 SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - COURT FINES AND FEES. During

27 operating costs to replace lost revenue from the removal of the indigent defense application
28 fees, for the biennium beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2027.

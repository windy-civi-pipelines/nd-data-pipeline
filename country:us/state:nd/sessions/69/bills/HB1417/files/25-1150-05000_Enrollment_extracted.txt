under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of
attorney's fees and expenses must be shown. In determining the amount and method of

condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any
time petition the court that imposed the condition to waive reimbursement of all or any
portion of the costs and expenses. If the court is satisfied that reimbursement of the
amount due will impose undue hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate
family, the court may waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or
modify the method of payment.

and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or enlarge the conditions

defense costs and expenses - Indigent defense administration fund - Continuing appropriation.

Section 77:
1. Lawyers provided to represent indigent persons must be compensated at a reasonable rate to
be determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents. Expenses necessary for the
adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in district court, other than for a violation
of a home rule county's ordinance, when approved by the commission, must be paid by the
state. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted for
violation of a home rule county's ordinance must be paid by the home rule county. Expenses
necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in municipal court,
when approved by the judge, must be paid by the city in which the alleged offense took place.
The city shall also pay the expenses in any matter transferred to district court pursuant to

Section 78:
section 40-18-06.2 or 40-18-15.1, in any appeal taken to district court from a judgment of
conviction in municipal court pursuant to section 40-18-19, and in an appeal or postconviction
matter seeking relief from a conviction resulting from violation of a municipal ordinance. A
defendant requesting representation by counsel at public expense, or for whom counsel
provided at public expense without a request is considered appropriate by the court, shall
submit an application for indigent defense services. For an application for indigent defense
services in the district court, a nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid
at the time the application is submitted. The district court may extend the time for payment of
the fee or may waive or reduce the fee if the court determines the defendant is financially
unable to pay all or part of the fee. If the application fee is not paid before disposition of the
case, the fee amount must be added to the amount to be reimbursed under this section.
Application fees collected under this subsection must be forwarded for deposit in the indigent
defense administration fund established under subsection 4.

Section 79:
2. A defendant for whom counsel is provided at public expense, subject to this subsection, shall
reimburse the state, home rule county, or city such sums as the state, home rule county, or
city expends on the defendant's behalf.
a. At the time counsel is provided for a defendant, the court shall advise the defendant of
the defendant's potential obligation to reimburse the appropriate governmental entity the
amounts expended on behalf of the defendant.
H. B. NO. 1417 - PAGE 11
b. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to pay
attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in any order or
amended judgment entered following a revocation or other postjudgment proceeding,
shall order the defendant to reimburse the presumed amount of indigent defense costs
and expenses, as determined by the commission, and shall notify the defendant of the
right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. If the defendant or prosecutor requests
a hearing within thirty days of receiving notice under this subdivision, the court shall
schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be
shown. In determining the amount of reimbursement and method of payment, the court
shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that
reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.
c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses and who
is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any time petition the court to waive
reimbursement of all or any portion of the attorney's fees and expenses. If the court is
satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on the
defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive reimbursement of all
or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of payment.

Section 80:
3. The attorney general, the state's attorney of the home rule county, or the prosecuting attorney
of the city in which the alleged offense took place, if reimbursement has not been received,
shall seek civil recovery of any amounts expended on the defendant's behalf anytime the
attorney general, state's attorney, or city attorney determines the person for whom counsel
was appointed may have funds to repay the state, home rule county, or city within six years of
the date such amount was paid on that person's behalf. A person against whom civil recovery
is sought under this subsection is entitled to all exemptions accorded to other judgment
debtors. The attorney general, state's attorney, or prosecuting attorney may contract with a
private sector collection agency for assistance in seeking recovery of such funds. Before
referring the matter to a collection agency, the state's attorney shall notify the person who is
the subject of the collection action.

Section 81:
4. The indigent defense administration fund is a special fund in the state treasury. The state
treasurer shall deposit in the fund all application fees collected under subsection 1. All moneys
in the indigent defense administration fund are appropriated on a continuing basis to the
commission on legal counsel for indigents to be used in the administration of the indigent
defense system.

Section 82:
SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - COURT FINES AND FEES. During the
2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall consider studying court fines and fees, including
fines and fees relating to travel permits, presentence investigations, the drug court program, electronic
monitoring, alcohol monitoring, and the twenty-four seven sobriety program. The study must consider
the total amount collected; rate of fees collected, including any money expended to collect the fines and
fees; an evaluation of practices in other states; and the overall impacts on a defendant. The legislative
management shall report its findings and recommendations, together with any legislation required to
implement the recommendations, to the seventieth legislative assembly.

request and certificate is addressed.
d. The petition for revocation of probation must be brought to the court for hearing within
ninety days after the receipt of the request and certificate by the court and prosecuting
official. If the petition is not brought to the court for hearing within the ninety days, the
court shall dismiss the petition with prejudice.
e. The parties may stipulate for a continuance or the court may grant a continuance upon a
showing of good cause by either party for a petition under this subsection.
f. If the defendant escapes from custody subsequent to the defendant's execution of a
request for final disposition of a petition for revocation, the request is considered void.
SECTION 5. AMENDMENT. Section 12.1-32-08 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
12.1-32-08. Hearing prior to ordering restitution, reparation, or reimbursement of indigent
defense costs and expenses - Conditions - Collection of restitution for insufficient funds
checks - Continuing appropriation.
1. The court, when sentencing a person adjudged guilty of criminal activities that have resulted in
pecuniary damages, in addition to any other sentence the court may impose, shall order that
the defendant make restitution to the victim or other recipient as determined by the court.
Restitution must include payment to the owner of real property that is contaminated by the
defendant in the manufacturing of methamphetamine for the cost of removing the
contamination and returning the property to the property's condition before contamination and
to any other person that has incurred costs in decontaminating the property.
2. If the court has retained jurisdiction after the sentencing hearing for claims of restitution, to
make a claim for restitution, the victim shall submit information by affidavit or declaration and,
as applicable, documentary evidence within the time specified in the order. The information
submitted must describe the items or elements of loss, itemize the total dollar amounts of
restitution claimed, and present facts and evidence sufficient to support a finding the
restitution is directly related to the offense and the amount awarded. The prosecutor shall
serve the defendant with a copy of the information submitted by the victim no later than sixty
days following sentencing.
3. The defendant may challenge restitution but must do so by requesting a hearing within thirty
days of being served with the written notification of the amount of restitution requested. The
hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the court. If no hearing is requested,
the court may enter a judgment ordering restitution. A defendant may not challenge restitution
after the thirty-day time period has passed.
4. In determining the amount of restitution, the court shall take into account the reasonable
damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which damages are limited

H. B. NO. 1417 - PAGE 9
to those directly related to the criminal offense and expenses actually sustained as a direct
result of the defendant's criminal action. This can include an amount equal to the cost of
necessary and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and
psychological care. The defendant may be required as part of the sentence imposed by the
court to pay the prescribed treatment costs for a victim of a sexual offense as defined in
chapters 12.1-20 and 12.1-27.2. The court shall fix the amount of restitution or reparation and
shall fix the manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established
pursuant to this subsection. The court may order the defendant to disclose income and assets
on forms developed by the state court administrator to facilitate the setting of an appropriate
payment plan. The court shall order restitution be paid to the division of adult services for any
benefits the division has paid or may pay to the victim under chapter 54-23.4 unless the court,
on the record, directs otherwise. Any payments made pursuant to the order must be deducted
from damages awarded in a civil action arising from the same incident.
5. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of
probation, unless the court directs otherwise, may be filed without filing fee, transcribed, and
enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by the division of adult
services in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the courts of this state may be
enforced. Upon thirty days' written notice to the victim's last known address, the court may
order the judgment imposing a duty to pay restitution or reparation be docketed in the same
manner as a civil judgment under section 29-26-22.1.
6. When the restitution ordered by the court under subsection 1 is the result of a finding that the
defendant issued a check or draft without sufficient funds or without an account, the court shall
impose as costs the greater of the sum of ten dollars or an amount equal to twenty-five
percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs imposed under this subsection,
however, may not exceed one thousand dollars. The state-employed clerks of district court
shall remit the funds collected as costs under this subsection to the state treasurer for deposit
in the restitution collection assistance fund. The funds deposited into the restitution collection
assistance fund are appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for the purpose
of defraying expenses incident to the collection of restitution, including operating expenses
and the compensation of additional necessary personnel. The state's attorneys and
county-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under this
subsection to the county treasurer to be deposited in the county general fund.
7. The court may order the defendant to perform reasonable assigned work as a condition of
probation, which assigned work need not be related to the offense charged, but must not be
solely for the benefit of a private individual other than the victim.
8. Under section 12.1-32-07, the court may order that the defendant reimburse indigent defense
costs and expenses as a condition of probation.
a. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to pay
attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in any order or
amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment proceeding, shall notify
the defendant, the defendant's probation officer, and the prosecuting attorney of the
presumed amount of costs and expenses to be reimbursed, as determined by the
commission on legal counsel for indigents, and of the right to a hearing on the
reimbursement amount. The reimbursement amount must include an application fee
imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the fee has not been paid before disposition of the
case and the court has not waived payment of the fee.
b. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving notice
under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of
attorney's fees and expenses must be shown. In determining the amount and method of
reimbursement, the court shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the
nature of the burden that reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.

H. B. NO. 1417 - PAGE 10
c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses as a
condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any
time petition the court that imposed the condition to waive reimbursement of all or any
portion of the costs and expenses. If the court is satisfied that reimbursement of the
amount due will impose undue hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate
family, the court may waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or
modify the method of payment.
d. If at any time the court finds that the defendant is able to reimburse costs and expenses
and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or enlarge the conditions
of probation or revoke probation as provided in subsection 6 or 7, as applicable, of
section 12.1-32-07.
9. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay a fine, supervision fee, reimbursement for
indigent defense costs and expenses, or restitution or reparations, the court may order the
defendant to perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of all or part of a fine, a supervision
fee, reimbursement for indigent defense costs and expenses, or restitution or reparations. The
defendant may not perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of restitution or reparations
unless the person entitled to restitution or reparations has consented in writing or on the
record.
SECTION 6. AMENDMENT. Section 29-07-01.1 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
29-07-01.1. Payment of expenses for defense of indigents - Reimbursement of indigent
defense costs and expenses - Indigent defense administration fund - Continuing appropriation.
1. Lawyers provided to represent indigent persons must be compensated at a reasonable rate to
be determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents. Expenses necessary for the
adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in district court, other than for a violation
of a home rule county's ordinance, when approved by the commission, must be paid by the
state. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted for
violation of a home rule county's ordinance must be paid by the home rule county. Expenses
necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in municipal court,
when approved by the judge, must be paid by the city in which the alleged offense took place.
The city shall also pay the expenses in any matter transferred to district court pursuant to
section 40-18-06.2 or 40-18-15.1, in any appeal taken to district court from a judgment of
conviction in municipal court pursuant to section 40-18-19, and in an appeal or postconviction
matter seeking relief from a conviction resulting from violation of a municipal ordinance. A
defendant requesting representation by counsel at public expense, or for whom counsel
provided at public expense without a request is considered appropriate by the court, shall
submit an application for indigent defense services. For an application for indigent defense
services in the district court, a nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid
at the time the application is submitted. The district court may extend the time for payment of
the fee or may waive or reduce the fee if the court determines the defendant is financially
unable to pay all or part of the fee. If the application fee is not paid before disposition of the
case, the fee amount must be added to the amount to be reimbursed under this section.
Application fees collected under this subsection must be forwarded for deposit in the indigent
defense administration fund established under subsection 4.
2. A defendant for whom counsel is provided at public expense, subject to this subsection, shall
reimburse the state, home rule county, or city such sums as the state, home rule county, or
city expends on the defendant's behalf.
a. At the time counsel is provided for a defendant, the court shall advise the defendant of
the defendant's potential obligation to reimburse the appropriate governmental entity the
amounts expended on behalf of the defendant.

H. B. NO. 1417 - PAGE 11
b. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to pay
attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in any order or
amended judgment entered following a revocation or other postjudgment proceeding,
shall order the defendant to reimburse the presumed amount of indigent defense costs
and expenses, as determined by the commission, and shall notify the defendant of the
right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. If the defendant or prosecutor requests
a hearing within thirty days of receiving notice under this subdivision, the court shall
schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of attorney's fees and expenses must be
shown. In determining the amount of reimbursement and method of payment, the court
shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that
reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.
c. A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses and who
is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any time petition the court to waive
reimbursement of all or any portion of the attorney's fees and expenses. If the court is
satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on the
defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive reimbursement of all
or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of payment.
3. The attorney general, the state's attorney of the home rule county, or the prosecuting attorney
of the city in which the alleged offense took place, if reimbursement has not been received,
shall seek civil recovery of any amounts expended on the defendant's behalf anytime the
attorney general, state's attorney, or city attorney determines the person for whom counsel
was appointed may have funds to repay the state, home rule county, or city within six years of
the date such amount was paid on that person's behalf. A person against whom civil recovery
is sought under this subsection is entitled to all exemptions accorded to other judgment
debtors. The attorney general, state's attorney, or prosecuting attorney may contract with a
private sector collection agency for assistance in seeking recovery of such funds. Before
referring the matter to a collection agency, the state's attorney shall notify the person who is
the subject of the collection action.
4. The indigent defense administration fund is a special fund in the state treasury. The state
treasurer shall deposit in the fund all application fees collected under subsection 1. All moneys
in the indigent defense administration fund are appropriated on a continuing basis to the
commission on legal counsel for indigents to be used in the administration of the indigent
defense system.
SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - COURT FINES AND FEES. During the
2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall consider studying court fines and fees, including
fines and fees relating to travel permits, presentence investigations, the drug court program, electronic
monitoring, alcohol monitoring, and the twenty-four seven sobriety program. The study must consider
the total amount collected; rate of fees collected, including any money expended to collect the fines and
fees; an evaluation of practices in other states; and the overall impacts on a defendant. The legislative
management shall report its findings and recommendations, together with any legislation required to
implement the recommendations, to the seventieth legislative assembly.

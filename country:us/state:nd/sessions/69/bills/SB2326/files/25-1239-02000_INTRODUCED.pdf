1 section, regardless of whether a petition for legal separation, annulment, or divorce

8 parte temporary protection order under section 14-07.1-03, must be attempted by

7 specified dangerous weapon, as defined in section 12.1-01-04, in the
8 respondent's immediate possession or control or subject to the respondent's
9 immediate control, if the court has probable cause to believe that the respondent
10 is likely to use, display, or threaten to use the firearm or other dangerous weapon
11 in any further acts of violence. If so ordered, the respondent shall surrender the
12 firearm or other dangerous weapon to the sheriff, or the sheriff's designee, of the
13 county in which the respondent resides or to the chief of police, or the chief's
14 designee, of the city in which the respondent resides in the manner and at the
15 time and place determined by that law enforcement officer. If the firearm or other

18 other dangerous weapon.
19 5. A court of competent jurisdiction may issue a dual protection order restricting both
20 parties involved in a domestic violence dispute if each party has commenced an action
21 pursuant to subsection 1 and the court, after a hearing, has made specific written
22 findings of fact that both parties committed acts of domestic violence and that neither
23 party acted in self-defense. The order must clearly define the responsibilities and
24 restrictions placed upon each party so that a law enforcement officer may readily
25 determine which party has violated the order if a violation is alleged to have occurred.
26 6. The court may amend its order or agreement at any time upon subsequent petition
27 filed by either party.
28 7. No order or agreement under this section affects title to any real property in any
29 matter.

1 9. Upon the application of an individual residing within the state, a court may issue a
2 domestic violence protection order or an ex parte temporary protection order under
3 this chapter even though the actions constituting domestic violence occurred
4 exclusively outside the state. In these cases, a respondent is subject to the personal
5 jurisdiction of this state upon entry into this state. If the domestic violence justifying the
6 issuance of a protection order under this chapter occurred exclusively outside the
7 state, the relief that may be granted is limited to an order restraining the party from
8 having contact with or committing acts of domestic violence on another person in this
9 state.
10 10. Whenever a protection order is issued, extended, modified, or terminated under this
11 section, the court shall transmit the order electronically to the bureau. The bureau shall
12 enter the order electronically in the national crime information center database
13 provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency. The sheriff of
14 the county in which the order was issued shall maintain and respond to inquiries
15 regarding the record in the national crime information center database provided by the
16 federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency, pursuant to bureau and
17 federal requirements. Whenever a protection order is issued, the clerk of court shall
18 forward a copy of the order to the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over
19 the residence of the protected party by the close of business on the day the protection
20 order is issued. Once the bureau, after consultation with the state court administrator,
21 determines and implements an electronic method to notify the sheriff of the county that
22 issued the order, the clerk of court's requirement to forward the order to a law
23 enforcement agency will be satisfied.
24 11. As used in this section and in section 14-07.1-03:
25 a. "Domestic violence" has the meaning provided in section 14-07.1-01 and
26 includes stalking.
27 b. "Stalking" has the meaning provided for in the term "stalk" in section
28 12.1-17-07.1.
29 12. A hearing on an application under this section is closed to the public. The court shall
30 allow to be present the parties, the parties' attorneys, the state's attorney, a domestic
31 violence sexual assault advocate certified under the North Dakota Supreme Court

1 Administrative Rules, and any witness and victim. The court may allow any other
2 individual the court determines has a proper interest in the hearing to be present.
3 13. The name of a victim in a protection order under this section is confidential and must
4 be redacted from a record that is otherwise accessible to the public.

6 hearing held after the effective date of this Act.

10 For purposes of this subsection, "raising agricultural crops" includes the storage of
11 harvested crops until the crop is delivered to the first end - point user. The existence o f
12 any of the conditions in subdivision a may not be used as a basis to exclude property
13 used to raise agricultural crops from being classified as agricultural property.

15 if the land is used for a nursery or other purpose associated with the operation of the
16 greenhouse. The time limitations contained in this section may not be construed to
17 prevent property that was assessed as other than agricultural property from being
18 assessed as agricultural property if the property otherwise qualifies under this
19 subsection.
20 a. Property platted on or after March 30, 1981, is not agricultural property when any

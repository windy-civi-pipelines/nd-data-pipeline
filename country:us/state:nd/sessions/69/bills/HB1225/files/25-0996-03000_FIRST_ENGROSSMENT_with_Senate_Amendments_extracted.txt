Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 a. The convicted offender is a dangerous, mentally abnormal person whose conduct
2 has been characterized by persistent aggressive behavior and the behavior
3 makes the offender a serious danger to other persons.
4 b. The convicted offender is a professional criminal who has substantial income or
5 resources derived from criminal activity.
6 c. The convicted offender is a habitual offender. The court may not make such a
7 finding unless the offender is an adult and has previously been convicted in any
8 state or states or by the United States of two felonies of class C or above
9 committed at different times when the offender was an adult. For the purposes of
10 this subdivision, a felony conviction in another state or under the laws of the
11 United States is considered a felony of class C or above if it is punishable by a
12 maximum term of imprisonment of five years or more.
13 d. The offender was convicted of an offense that seriously endangered the life of
14 another person and the offender had previously been convicted of a similar

19 A conviction shown on direct or collateral review or at the hearing to be invalid or for
20 which the offender has been pardoned on the ground of innocence must be
21 disregarded for purposes of subdivision c. In support of findings under subdivision b, it
22 may be shown that the offender has had control of income or property not explained
23 as derived from a source other than criminal activity. For purposes of subdivision b, a
24 substantial source of income means a source of income which for any period of one
25 year or more exceeds the minimum wage, determined on the basis of a forty-hour
26 week and a fifty-week year, without reference to exceptions, under section 6(a)(1) of
27 the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, for an employee engaged in
28 commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, and which for the same period
29 exceeds fifty percent of the offender's declared adjusted gross income under chapter
30 57-38.

2 impose a sentence up to a maximum of life imprisonment.
3 b. If the offense for which the offender is convicted is a class B felony, the court may
4 impose a sentence up to a maximum of imprisonment for twenty years.
5 c. If the offense for which the offender is convicted is a class C felony, the court may
6 impose a sentence up to a maximum of imprisonment for ten years.
7 3. Whenever an attorney charged with the prosecution of a defendant in a court of this
8 state for an alleged felony committed when the defendant was over the age of
9 eighteen years has reason to believe that the defendant is a dangerous special
10 offender or a habitual offender, the attorney, at a reasonable time before trial or
11 acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, may sign and file with the court, and may
12 amend, a notice specifying that the defendant is a dangerous special offender or a
13 habitual offender who upon conviction for the felony is subject to the imposition of a
14 sentence under subsection 2, and setting out with particularity the reasons why the
15 attorney believes the defendant to be a dangerous special offender or a habitual
16 offender. In no case may the fact that the prosecuting attorney is seeking sentencing
17 of the defendant as a dangerous special offender or a habitual offender be disclosed
18 to the jury before a verdict. If the court finds that the filing of the notice as a public
19 record may prejudice fair consideration of a pending criminal matter, the court may
20 order the notice sealed and the notice is not subject to subpoena or public inspection
21 during the pendency of the criminal matter, except on order of the court, but is subject
22 to inspection by the defendant alleged to be a dangerous special offender or a habitual
23 offender and the offender's counsel.
24 4. Upon any plea of guilty, or verdict or finding of guilt of the defendant of such felony, a
25 hearing must be held, before sentence is imposed, in accordance with this subsection
26 as follows:
27 a. By a jury, or the court if a jury is waived by the defendant, if the notice alleges
28 that the defendant is a dangerous special offender under subdivision a, b, d, or e
29 of subsection 1. The jury, or the court if a jury is waived, must find that the
30 defendant is a dangerous special offender under one or more of these
31 subdivisions by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in the case of a
Page No. 3 25.0996.03000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 notice alleging only subdivision e of subsection 1, the trial jury, or the trial court if
2 a jury is waived, may make a special finding of proof of this subdivision without
3 an additional hearing subsequent to a verdict or finding of guilt.
4 b. By the court if the notice alleges that the defendant is a habitual offender under
5 subdivision c of subsection 1. The court must find that the defendant is a habitual
6 offender by a preponderance of the evidence.
7 5. Except in the most extraordinary cases, the court shall obtain a presentence report
8 and may receive a diagnostic testing report under subsection 5 of section 12.1-32-02
9 before holding a hearing under this subsection. The court shall fix a time for the
10 hearing and notice thereof must be given to the defendant and the prosecution at least
11 five days prior thereto. The court shall permit the prosecution and counsel for the
12 defendant, or the defendant if the defendant is not represented by counsel, to inspect
13 the presentence report sufficiently before the hearing as to afford a reasonable
14 opportunity for verification. In extraordinary cases, the court may withhold material not
15 relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinion that might seriously disrupt a
16 program of rehabilitation, any source of information obtained on a promise of
17 confidentiality, and material previously disclosed in open court. A court withholding all
18 or part of a presentence report shall inform the parties of its action and place in the
19 record the reasons therefor. The court may require parties inspecting all or part of a
20 presentence report to give notice of any part thereof intended to be controverted. In
21 connection with the hearing, the defendant is entitled to compulsory process and
22 cross-examination of such witnesses as appear at the hearing. A duly authenticated
23 copy of a former judgment or commitment is prima facie evidence of such former
24 judgment or commitment. If the jury or the court finds, after hearing, one or more of the
25 grounds set forth in subsection 1, that the defendant is a dangerous special offender
26 or a habitual offender, the court shall sentence the defendant to imprisonment for an
27 appropriate term within the limits specified in subsection 2.

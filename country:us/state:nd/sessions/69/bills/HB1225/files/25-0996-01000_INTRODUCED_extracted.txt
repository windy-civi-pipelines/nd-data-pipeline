1 c. The convicted offender is a habitual offender. The court may not make such a
2 finding unless the offender is an adult and has previously been convicted in any
3 state or states or by the United States of two felonies of class C or above
4 committed at different times when the offender was an adult. For the purposes of
5 this subdivision, a felony conviction in another state or under the laws of the
6 United States is considered a felony of class C or above if it is punishable by a
7 maximum term of imprisonment of five years or more than three hundred sixty
8 days of imprisonment.
9 d. The offender was convicted of an offense that seriously endangered the life of
10 another person and the offender had previously been convicted of a similar

19 as derived from a source other than criminal activity. For purposes of subdivision b, a
20 substantial source of income means a source of income which for any period of one
21 year or more exceeds the minimum wage, determined on the basis of a forty-hour
22 week and a fifty-week year, without reference to exceptions, under section 6(a)(1) of
23 the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, for an employee engaged in

26 57-38.

1 c. If the offense for which the offender is convicted is a class C felony, the court may
2 impose a sentence up to a maximum of imprisonment for ten years.
3 3. Whenever an attorney charged with the prosecution of a defendant in a court of this
4 state for an alleged felony committed when the defendant was over the age of
5 eighteen years has reason to believe that the defendant is a dangerous special
6 offender or a habitual offender, the attorney, at a reasonable time before trial or
7 acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, may sign and file with the court, and may
8 amend, a notice specifying that the defendant is a dangerous special offender or a
9 habitual offender who upon conviction for the felony is subject to the imposition of a
10 sentence under subsection 2, and setting out with particularity the reasons why the
11 attorney believes the defendant to be a dangerous special offender or a habitual
12 offender. In no case may the fact that the prosecuting attorney is seeking sentencing
13 of the defendant as a dangerous special offender or a habitual offender be disclosed
14 to the jury before a verdict. If the court finds that the filing of the notice as a public
15 record may prejudice fair consideration of a pending criminal matter, the court may
16 order the notice sealed and the notice is not subject to subpoena or public inspection
17 during the pendency of the criminal matter, except on order of the court, but is subject
18 to inspection by the defendant alleged to be a dangerous special offender or a habitual
19 offender and the offender's counsel.
20 4. Upon any plea of guilty, or verdict or finding of guilt of the defendant of such felony, a
21 hearing must be held, before sentence is imposed, in accordance with this subsection
22 as follows:
23 a. By a jury, or the court if a jury is waived by the defendant, if the notice alleges
24 that the defendant is a dangerous special offender under subdivision a, b, d, or e
25 of subsection 1. The jury, or the court if a jury is waived, must find that the
26 defendant is a dangerous special offender under one or more of these
27 subdivisions by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in the case of a
28 notice alleging only subdivision e of subsection 1, the trial jury, or the trial court if
29 a jury is waived, may make a special finding of proof of this subdivision without
30 an additional hearing subsequent to a verdict or finding of guilt.

1 b. By the court if the notice alleges that the defendant is a habitual offender under
2 subdivision c of subsection 1. The court must find that the defendant is a habitual
3 offender by a preponderance of the evidence.
4 5. Except in the most extraordinary cases, the court shall obtain a presentence report
5 and may receive a diagnostic testing report under subsection 5 of section 12.1-32-02
6 before holding a hearing under this subsection. The court shall fix a time for the
7 hearing and notice thereof must be given to the defendant and the prosecution at least
8 five days prior thereto. The court shall permit the prosecution and counsel for the
9 defendant, or the defendant if the defendant is not represented by counsel, to inspect
10 the presentence report sufficiently before the hearing as to afford a reasonable
11 opportunity for verification. In extraordinary cases, the court may withhold material not
12 relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinion that might seriously disrupt a
13 program of rehabilitation, any source of information obtained on a promise of
14 confidentiality, and material previously disclosed in open court. A court withholding all
15 or part of a presentence report shall inform the parties of its action and place in the
16 record the reasons therefor. The court may require parties inspecting all or part of a
17 presentence report to give notice of any part thereof intended to be controverted. In
18 connection with the hearing, the defendant is entitled to compulsory process and
19 cross-examination of such witnesses as appear at the hearing. A duly authenticated
20 copy of a former judgment or commitment is prima facie evidence of such former
21 judgment or commitment. If the jury or the court finds, after hearing, one or more of the
22 grounds set forth in subsection 1, that the defendant is a dangerous special offender
23 or a habitual offender, the court shall sentence the defendant to imprisonment for an
24 appropriate term within the limits specified in subsection 2.

13 available, the agency may, upon approval of the legislative assembly, or the
14 budget section if the legislative assembly is not in session, use general fund
15 moneys to pay for the audit. Any budget section action under this subdivision
16 must comply with section 54-35-02.9.
17 d. Except for the audit of the department of financial institutions as outlined in

21 fiscal review committee if the legislative assembly is not in session. When
22 determining the necessity of a performance audit, the legislative audit and fiscal
23 review committee shall consider:
24 (1) The potential cost-savings or efficiencies that may be gained as a result of
25 the performance audit;
26 (2) The staff resources of the state auditor's office and of the state agency
27 being audited which will be required to conduct the audit;
28 (3) The potential for discovery of noncompliance with state law or legislative
29 intent regarding the program or agency; and
30 (4) The potential for the performance audit to identify opportunities for program

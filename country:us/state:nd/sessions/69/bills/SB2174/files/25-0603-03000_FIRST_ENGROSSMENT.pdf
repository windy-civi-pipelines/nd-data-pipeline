29 sixty days of receipt, the animal feeding operation is deemed in compliance with
30 the county zoning regulations. If the county allows animal feeding operations as a
31 conditional use, the conditional use regulations must be limited to the board's
Page No. 3 25.0603.03000

27 improvements or other modifications of an operation that is in current
28 compliance with state and federal regulations or require an existing
29 operation to have a permit for improvements or other modifications that
30 bring the operation into compliance with state or federal regulations, if the

1 modifications or improvements do not cause the operation to exceed animal
2 numbers of the setback requirement.
3 10. If a party challenges the validity of a county ordinance, determination, decision, or

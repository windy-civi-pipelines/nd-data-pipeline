causes the death of the unborn child is the mother. A violation of this subsection is a class A
felony. If an individual commits a violation under this subsection, the court shall impose at

previously convicted of a violation of section 39-08-01 or 39-08-03, or equivalent ordinance,
the court shall impose at least ten years' imprisonment. An individual may not be prosecuted
and found guilty of this and an offense under chapter 12.1-16 if the conduct arises out of the

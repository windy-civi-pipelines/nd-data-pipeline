5 SECTION 1. APPROPRIATION - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE - STRATEGIC
6 INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS FUND - UNCREWED AERIAL VEHICLE
7 REPLACEMENT PROGRAM - LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT REPORT - ONE-TIME
8 FUNDING. There is appropriated out of any moneys in the strategic investment and
9 improvements fund in the state treasury, not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $15,000,000, or
10 so much of the sum as may be necessary, to the department of commerce for the purpose of
11 administering an uncrewed aerial vehicle replacement program, for the period beginning with

13 funding item.
14 1. The department of commerce shall collaborate with the uncrewed aircraft systems test

16 the control of the state board of higher education, to replace uncrewed aerial vehicles
17 owned by the state which do not comply with requirements of the federal National
18 Defense Authorization Act and the American Security Drone Act of 2023. A state
19 agency owning an uncrewed aerial vehicle before January 1, 2025, is eligible to
20 receive a new uncrewed aerial vehicle that is in compliance with federal requirements
21 and is of equivalent capability to the agency's existing uncrewed aerial vehicle. The

6 uncrewed aerial vehicles.
7 2. Any uncrewed aerial vehicle replaced under this section must be remitted to the
8 uncrewed aircraft systems test site for proper decommissioning and disposal pursuant
9 to federal and state regulations, which may include the sale of uncrewed aerial
10 vehicles to the United States department of homeland security at market rates for use
11 in the counter unmanned aircraft system program. The department of commerce shall
12 remit any funding received under this section to the state treasurer for deposit in the
13 general fund.
14 3. The department of commerce shall maintain an inventory of uncrewed aerial vehicles
15 purchased for state agencies under this section and encourage state agencies to use
16 the state beyond visual line of sight program. The uncrewed aircraft systems test site
17 shall provide guidance to state agencies regarding the integration of uncrewed aerial
18 vehicles into the beyond visual line of sight system and proper maintenance schedules
19 for uncrewed aerial vehicles. The uncrewed aircraft systems test site shall establish a
20 centralized system for state agencies to register uncrewed aerial vehicles and
21 authorized operators for accessing the beyond visual line of sight system and shall
22 provide operational support when state agencies use uncrewed aircraft systems test
23 site integrated platforms.
24 4. During the 2025-26 interim, the department of commerce shall compile information
25 from state agencies and provide a report to the legislative management by June 30,
26 2026, regarding the status of the program, funding spent on uncrewed aerial vehicle
27 replacements and training costs, the number of uncrewed aerial vehicles replaced in
28 each state agency, the number of uncrewed aerial vehicles sold or disposed, and any
29 future needs for each state agency to be compliant with the federal National Defense
30 Authorization Act and the American Security Drone Act of 2023.

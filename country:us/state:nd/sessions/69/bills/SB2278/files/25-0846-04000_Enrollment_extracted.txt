Section 2:
SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - RETENTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.
During the 2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall consider studying the feasibility and
desirability of requiring libraries maintained by state agencies, including the state library and libraries at
institutions under the control of the state board of higher education, to retain a copy of any book or
other written material that contains the material's original text if the publisher of the material publishes a
new version to update language that was common when the material was originally published to
language that is considered more socially progressive, politically correct, inclusive, or less socially
offensive. The study must include an analysis of how artificial intelligence has or will affect the retention
of library materials, how library materials are updated or altered using artificial intelligence, and the
fiscal and operational impact of collection management. The legislative management shall report its
findings and recommendations, together with any legislation required to implement the
recommendations, to the seventieth legislative assembly.

SENATE BILL NO. 2210
(Senators Weber, Dwyer, Luick, Sorvaag)
(Representatives Brandenburg, Schreiber-Beck)
AN ACT to provide for a legislative management study relating to the management of water based on
watershed boundaries.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - WATER MANAGEMENT BASED ON
WATERSHED BOUNDARIES. During the 2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall study the
feasibility and desirability of assigning management authority for the waters of the state to the area
located in the naturally occurring watershed, rather than assigning management authority based on
political subdivision boundaries. The study must review the approaches used for managing water in
surrounding states; the powers, duties, and organizational structure of watershed boards; dispute
resolution procedures afforded to individuals residing within the boundaries of a watershed district; the
mechanism to initiate, implement, and improve works projects within a watershed district; and the role
of the department of water resources in mapping and establishing watershed boundaries. The
legislative management shall report its findings and recommendations, together with any legislation
required to implement the recommendations, to the seventieth legislative assembly.

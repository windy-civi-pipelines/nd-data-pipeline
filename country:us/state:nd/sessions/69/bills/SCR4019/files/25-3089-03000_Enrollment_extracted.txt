A concurrent resolution directing the Legislative Management to consider studying reading and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF NORTH DAKOTA, THE HOUSE

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include an examination of academic disparities, analyzing
the latest student performance data on statewide reading and mathematics assessments to identify
trends and disparities affecting students with disabilities and comparing the subgroup performance to
overall state proficiency rates; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include an identification of contributing factors, evaluating
systemic barriers contributing to low proficiency rates, including funding for special education services,
limited access to trained teachers and support staff, geographic disparities between rural and urban
areas, and accessibility of evidence-based curriculum and instructional strategies; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include an assessment of existing policies and programs,
reviewing the implementation and impact of current state and federally funded programs and identifying
gaps in policy, funding, and program effectiveness; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include the engagement of stakeholders, soliciting input
from parents and families of students with disabilities to ensure parent involvement in decisionmaking,
educators, school administrators, special education professionals, and advocacy groups focused on
disability rights; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include research of best practices, examining successful
models and initiatives in states that have effectively reduced proficiency disparities and exploring
innovative approaches in early literacy, numeracy, and equitable education practices; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the study include consideration of actionable policy and funding
recommendations aimed at reducing proficiency disparities, expanding access to high-quality, evidence-
based educational programs, enhancing transparency in costs and resource allocation, and improving
accountability and data transparency; and

4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
5 SECTION 1. A new section to chapter 38-09 of the North Dakota Century Code is created
6 and enacted as follows:
7 Oil and gas lease sales - Permissibility - Penalty.
8 1. The industrial commission shall adopt and issue rules establishing if an applicant for
9 an oil and gas lease on state lands or state school lands is considered a qualified oil
10 and gas lease applicant. Before issuing a lease of any state lands or state school
11 lands for oil and gas production under this chapter or chapter 15-05, the commissioner
12 of university and school lands, subject to criteria established by the industrial
13 commission, shall review the highest bid offered by an applicant to determine if the
14 applicant is a qualified oil and gas lease applicant.
15 2. If the highest bidder is not a qualified bidder, the commissioner of university and
16 school lands shall consider the second highest bidder to determine if that bidder is a
17 qualified applicant, to which the commissioner of university and school lands may
18 issue the lease if the applicant agrees to lease the lands for the highest amount bid
19 before the disqualified applicant entered the lease auction or process or for the
20 amount the second highest bidder bid, whichever is lower.
21 3. An applicant whose bid is rejected under this section because the applicant is not a
22 qualified oil and gas lease applicant is subject to a civil penalty in the amount of the
23 applicant's highest bid. The attorney general may bring an action in a court of
24 competent jurisdiction to recover the penalty specified in this subsection.

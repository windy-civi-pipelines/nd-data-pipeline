1 3. a. A person seeking to install a subsurface water management system under this
2 section shall provide the notice under subsection 1 through certified mail with a
3 proof of delivery signed by the downstream landowner.
4 b. The downstream landowner has thirty days from the receipt of the notice to
5 deliver a written objection to the person seeking to install the subsurface water
6 management system and the board of the water resource district in which the
7 majority of the land subject to the planned system is located.
8 c. If the downstream landowner:
9 (1) Fails to timely deliver the written objection, the person may install the
10 subsurface water management system.
11 (2) Timely delivers the written objection, the water resource district in which the
12 majority of the land subject to the planned system is located shall require
13 the person to complete and file a permit application as required under
14 section 61 - 32 - 03.1 .
15 e. Upon receipt of the permit application, the water resource district shall review,
16 analyze, and issue permits in the same manner as provided under section

18 4. If a subsurface water management system for which notification is required under

20 resource board that receives the notice may require the relevant property to be
21 included in the assessment district for the assessment drain in accordance with the
22 benefits the property receives, provided the property is not assessed already for the
23 assessment drain. The water resource district also may include the property in the
24 assessment district and determine the benefits and assessment amounts under
25 chapters 61-21 and 61-16.1, without conducting the reassessment of benefit
26 proceedings under sections 61-21-44 and 61-16.1-26, provided the property is not

28 4.5. The board of the water resource district within which the subsurface water
29 management system is located may order the system's owner or operator to bring the
30 system into compliance with subsection 2 if the board finds the system violates that
31 subsection.

5 consisting of a hydrologist employed by the state, an engineer employed by the state,
6 and an individual conducting farming or ranching in the county in which the subsurface
7 water management system is located. All mediation costs must be paid by the owner
8 of the subsurface water management system. An opinion issued by the mediation

10 party from commencing a civil action to recover damages after completion of the
11 mediation.

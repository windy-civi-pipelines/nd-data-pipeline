13 the control of the state board of higher education, to replace uncrewed aerial vehicles
14 owned by the state which do not comply with requirements of the federal National
15 Defense Authorization Act and the American Security Drone Act of 2023. The
16 information technology department, in consultation with the department of commerce
17 and the uncrewed aircraft systems test site, may implement an enterprise uncrewed
18 aerial vehicle data management solution. An enterprise uncrewed aerial vehicle data
19 management solution implemented under this section must ensure all data collected,
20 transmitted, stored, and consumed by an uncrewed aerial vehicle remain under the
21 control of the state. As used in this section "enterprise uncrewed aerial vehicle data
22 management solution" means a system for secure, end-to-end data collection,
23 transportation, storage, processing, and consumption through enterprise software. A
24 state agency owning an uncrewed aerial vehicle before January 1, 2025, is eligible to
25 receive a new uncrewed aerial vehicle that is in compliance with federal requirements
26 and is of equivalent capability to the agency's existing uncrewed aerial vehicle. The
27 department of commerce shall purchase each uncrewed aerial vehicle based on the
28 needs of the agency and a recommendation from the uncrewed aircraft systems test
29 site and provide the uncrewed aerial vehicle to the agency. The department of
30 commerce shall use a portion of the funding provided in this section to pay for training
31 needed for agency staff to operate the new uncrewed aerial vehicle. The department

8 in the counter unmanned aircraft system program. The department of commerce shall
9 remit any funding received under this section to the state treasurer for deposit in the
10 general fund.
11 3. The department of commerce shall maintain an inventory of uncrewed aerial vehicles
12 purchased for state agencies under this section and encourage state agencies to use
13 the state beyond visual line of sight program. The uncrewed aircraft systems test site
14 shall provide guidance to state agencies regarding the integration of uncrewed aerial
15 vehicles into the beyond visual line of sight system and proper maintenance schedules
16 for uncrewed aerial vehicles. The uncrewed aircraft systems test site shall establish a
17 centralized system for state agencies to register uncrewed aerial vehicles and
18 authorized operators for accessing the beyond visual line of sight system and shall
19 provide operational support when state agencies use uncrewed aircraft systems test
20 site integrated platforms.
21 4. During the 2025-26 interim, the department of commerce shall compile information
22 from state agencies and provide a report to the legislative management by June 30,

14 c. For the life of the individual, if that individual:
15 (1) On two or more occasions has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been

26 (3) Is assigned a high risk by the attorney general as provided in subsection 12.
27 9. An individual required to register under this section who violates this section is guilty of
28 a class C felony. The failure of a homeless individual to register as required in

12 individual is released from the facility or institution. This subsection does not apply to
13 any individual temporarily released under guard from the facility or institution in which
14 that individual is confined.
15 12. The attorney general, with the assistance of the department and the juvenile courts,
16 shall develop guidelines for the risk assessment of sexual offenders who are required
17 to register, with a low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk level being assigned to each
18 offender as follows:

11 13. An individual assessed as a high-risk sexual offender in accordance with
12 subsection 12, may not reside within five hundred feet [152.4 meters] of a public or
13 nonpublic preschool or elementary, middle, or high school.
14 14. Relevant and necessary conviction and registration information must be disclosed to
15 the public by a law enforcement agency if the individual is a moderate or high risk and
16 the agency determines that disclosure of the conviction and registration information is
17 necessary for public protection. The attorney general shall develop guidelines for

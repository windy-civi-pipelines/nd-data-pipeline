13 photograph of the individual. An individual who is not required to provide a sample of
14 blood and other body fluids under section 31-13-03 or by the individual's state or court
15 of conviction or adjudication shall submit a sample of blood and other body fluids for
16 inclusion in a centralized database of DNA identification records under section
17 31-13-05. The collection, submission, testing and analysis of, and records produced
18 from, samples of blood and other body fluids, are subject to chapter 31-13. Evidence
19 of the DNA profile comparison is admissible in accordance with section 31-13-02. A
20 report of the DNA analysis certified by the state crime laboratory is admissible in
21 accordance with section 31-13-05. A district court shall order an individual who refuses
22 to submit a sample of blood or other body fluids for registration purposes to show
23 cause at a specified time and place why the individual should not be required to
24 submit the sample required under this subsection. Within three days after registration,
25 the registering law enforcement agency shall forward the statement, biometric data,
26 and photograph to the attorney general and shall submit the sample of the individual's
27 blood and body fluids to the state crime laboratory. If an individual required to register

Page No. 7 25.0034.03000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 section has a change in name, school, or residence or employment address, that
2 individual shall register, at least ten days before the change, with the law enforcement
3 agency having local jurisdiction of the individual's place of residence of the individual's
4 new name, school, residence address, or employment address. A change in school or
5 employment address includes the termination of school or employment for which an
6 individual required to register under this section, the individual shall register within
7 three days of the termination with the law enforcement agency having local jurisdiction
8 of the individual's place of residence. The law enforcement agency, within three days
9 after receipt of the information, shall forward it to the attorney general. The attorney
10 general shall forward the appropriate registration data to the law enforcement agency
11 having local jurisdiction of the new place of residence, school, or employment. Upon a
12 change of address, the individual required to register also shall register within three
13 days at the law enforcement agency having local jurisdiction of the new place of
14 residence. If an individual required to register in North Dakota, including in a tribal
15 registry, resides in another state or on tribal lands, that individual shall register
16 employment and school addresses and any changes in required registration
17 information with the law enforcement agency having local jurisdiction over the school
18 or employment address. The individual registering under this section shall periodically
19 confirm the information required under this subsection in a manner and at an interval
20 determined by the attorney general. A law enforcement agency that has previously
21 registered an offender may omit the biometric data portion of the registration if that
22 agency has a set of biometric data on file for that individual and is personally familiar
23 with and can visually identify the offender. These provisions also apply in any other
24 state that requires registration.
25 8. An individual required to register under this section shall comply with the registration
26 requirement for the longer of the following periods:
27 a. A period of fifteen years after the date of sentence or order deferring or
28 suspending sentence upon a plea or finding of guilt or after release from

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 incarceration, whichever is later, if the offender is assigned a moderate risk by the
2 attorney general as provided in subsection 12; or
3 c. For the life of the individual, if that individual:
4 (1) On two or more occasions has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been
5 found guilty of a crime against a child or as a sexual offender. If all qualifying
6 offenses are misdemeanors, this lifetime provision does not apply unless a
7 qualifying offense was committed after August 1, 1999;
8 (2) Pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, or is found guilty of, an offense
9 committed after August 1, 1999, which is described in subdivision a of
10 subsection 1 of section 12.1-20-03, section 12.1-20-03.1, or subdivision d of
11 subsection 1 of section 12.1-20-03 if the person is an adult and the victim is
12 under age twelve, or section 12.1-18-01 if that individual is an adult other

14 the United States, a tribal court, or court of another country; or
15 (3) Is assigned a high risk by the attorney general as provided in subsection 12.
16 9. An individual required to register under this section who violates this section is guilty of
17 a class C felony. The failure of a homeless individual to register as required in
18 subsections 2 and 3 is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. The clerk of
19 court shall forward all warrants issued for a violation of this section to the county
20 sheriff, who shall enter all such warrants into the national crime information center
21 wanted person file. A court may not relieve an individual, other than a juvenile, who
22 violates this section from serving a term of at least ninety days in jail and completing
23 probation of one year.
24 10. When an individual is released on parole or probation and is required to register
25 pursuant to this section, but fails to do so within the time prescribed, the court shall
26 order the probation, or the parole board shall order the parole, of the individual
27 revoked.
28 11. If an individual required to register pursuant to this section is temporarily sent outside
29 the facility or institution where that individual is confined under conviction or sentence,
30 the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the place where that
31 individual is being sent must be notified within a reasonable time period before that
Page No. 9 25.0034.03000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 individual is released from the facility or institution. This subsection does not apply to
2 any individual temporarily released under guard from the facility or institution in which
3 that individual is confined.
4 12. The attorney general, with the assistance of the department and the juvenile courts,
5 shall develop guidelines for the risk assessment of sexual offenders who are required
6 to register, with a low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk level being assigned to each
7 offender as follows:
8 a. The department shall conduct a risk assessment of sexual offenders who are
9 incarcerated in institutions under the control of the department and sexual
10 offenders who are on supervised probation. The department, in a timely manner,
11 shall provide the attorney general any information, including the offender's level
12 of risk and supporting documentation, concerning individuals required to be
13 registered under this section who are about to be released or placed into the
14 community.
15 b. The attorney general shall conduct a risk assessment of sexual offenders who
16 are not under the custody or supervision of the department. The attorney general
17 may adopt a law enforcement agency's previous assignment of risk level for an
18 individual if the assessment was conducted in a manner substantially similar to
19 the guidelines developed under this subsection.
20 c. The juvenile courts or the agency having legal custody of a juvenile shall conduct
21 a risk assessment of juvenile sexual offenders who are required to register under
22 this section. The juvenile courts or the agency having legal custody of a juvenile

24 of risk and supporting documentation, concerning juveniles required to register
25 and who are about to be released or placed into the community.
26 d. The attorney general shall notify the offender of the risk level assigned to that
27 offender. An offender may request a review of that determination with the attorney
28 general's sexual offender risk assessment committee and may present any
29 information that the offender believes may lower the assigned risk level.
Page No. 10 25.0034.03000

Legislative Assembly
1 13. An individual assessed as a high-risk sexual offender in accordance with
2 subsection 12, may not reside within five hundred feet [152.4 meters] of a public or
3 nonpublic preschool or elementary, middle, or high school.
4 14. Relevant and necessary conviction and registration information must be disclosed to
5 the public by a law enforcement agency if the individual is a moderate or high risk and
6 the agency determines that disclosure of the conviction and registration information is
7 necessary for public protection. The attorney general shall develop guidelines for
8 public disclosure of offender registration information. Public disclosure may include
9 internet access if the offender:
10 a. Is required to register for a lifetime under subsection 8;
11 b. Has been determined to be a high risk to the public by the department, the
12 attorney general, or the courts, according to guidelines developed by those
13 agencies; or
14 c. Has been determined to be a high risk to the public by an agency of another state
15 or the federal government.
16 If the offender has been determined to be a moderate risk, public disclosure must
17 include, at a minimum, notification of the offense to the victim registered under chapter
18 12.1-34 and to any agency, civic organization, or group of persons who have
19 characteristics similar to those of a victim of the offender. Upon request, law
20 enforcement agencies may release conviction and registration information regarding
21 low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk offenders.
22 15. A state officer, law enforcement agency, or public school district or governing body of a
23 nonpublic school or any appointee, officer, or employee of those entities is not subject
24 to civil or criminal liability for making risk determinations, allowing a sexual offender to
25 attend a school function under section 12.1-20-25, or for disclosing or for failing to
26 disclose information as permitted by this section.
27 16. If a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent and required or ordered to register as a sexual
28 offender or as an offender against a child under this section, the juvenile shall comply
29 with the registration requirements in this section. Notwithstanding any other provision
30 of law, a law enforcement agency shall register a juvenile offender in the same manner
31 as adult offenders and may release any relevant and necessary information on file to
Page No. 11 25.0034.03000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 other law enforcement agencies, the department of health and human services, or the
2 public if disclosure is necessary to protect public health or safety. The law enforcement
3 agency shall release any relevant and necessary information on file to the
4 superintendent or principal of the school the juvenile attends. The school
5 administration shall notify others in similar positions if the juvenile transfers to another
6 learning institution in or outside the state.
7 17. If an individual has been required to register as a sexual offender or an offender
8 against a child under section 12.1-32-15 or former section 27-20-52.1 before August 1,
9 1999, the individual may petition the court to be removed from the offender list if
10 registration is no longer mandatory for that individual. In considering the petition, the
11 court shall comply with the requirements of this section.
12 18. A sexual offender who is currently assigned a moderate or high-risk level by the
13 attorney general may not use a state park of this state as a residence or residential
14 address to comply with the registration requirements of this section. Before arriving at
15 a state park for overnight lodging or camping, a sexual offender who is assigned a
16 moderate or high-risk level by the attorney general shall notify a parks and recreation
17 department law enforcement officer at the state park where the sexual offender will be
18 staying.
19 19. When an individual who is required to register pursuant to this section plans to travel
20 outside of the United States, at least twenty-one days before the intended travel, the
21 individual shall inform the agency with which the individual last registered the
22 individual's residence address the details of the intended travel. Upon receipt of the
23 information from the registering law enforcement agency, the attorney general shall
24 report the travel to the United States marshal service.

15 of conviction or adjudication shall submit a sample of blood and other body fluids for
16 inclusion in a centralized database of DNA identification records under section

5 employment address includes the termination of school or employment for which an
6 individual required to register under this section, the individual shall register within
7 three days of the termination with the law enforcement agency having local jurisdiction
8 of the individual's place of residence. The law enforcement agency, within three days
9 after receipt of the information, shall forward it to the attorney general. The attorney
10 general shall forward the appropriate registration data to the law enforcement agency
11 having local jurisdiction of the new place of residence, school, or employment. Upon a

15 registry, resides in another state or on tribal lands, that individual shall register
16 employment and school addresses and any changes in required registration
17 information with the law enforcement agency having local jurisdiction over the school
18 or employment address. The individual registering under this section shall periodically
19 confirm the information required under this subsection in a manner and at an interval
20 determined by the attorney general. A law enforcement agency that has previously
21 registered an offender may omit the biometric data portion of the registration if that

23 with and can visually identify the offender. These provisions also apply in any other
24 state that requires registration.

3 c. For the life of the individual, if that individual:
4 (1) On two or more occasions has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been

15 (3) Is assigned a high risk by the attorney general as provided in subsection 12.
16 9. An individual required to register under this section who violates this section is guilty of
17 a class C felony. The failure of a homeless individual to register as required in
18 subsections 2 and 3 is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. The clerk of
19 court shall forward all warrants issued for a violation of this section to the county
20 sheriff, who shall enter all such warrants into the national crime information center
21 wanted person file. A court may not relieve an individual, other than a juvenile, who

2 any individual temporarily released under guard from the facility or institution in which
3 that individual is confined.
4 12. The attorney general, with the assistance of the department and the juvenile courts,
5 shall develop guidelines for the risk assessment of sexual offenders who are required
6 to register, with a low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk level being assigned to each
7 offender as follows:

13 registered under this section who are about to be released or placed into the
14 community.
15 b. The attorney general shall conduct a risk assessment of sexual offenders who
16 are not under the custody or supervision of the department. The attorney general

19 the guidelines developed under this subsection.
20 c. The juvenile courts or the agency having legal custody of a juvenile shall conduct

3 nonpublic preschool or elementary, middle, or high school.
4 14. Relevant and necessary conviction and registration information must be disclosed to
5 the public by a law enforcement agency if the individual is a moderate or high risk and
6 the agency determines that disclosure of the conviction and registration information is
7 necessary for public protection. The attorney general shall develop guidelines for
8 public disclosure of offender registration information. Public disclosure may include
9 internet access if the offender:
10 a. Is required to register for a lifetime under subsection 8;

17 include, at a minimum, notification of the offense to the victim registered under chapter
18 12.1-34 and to any agency, civic organization, or group of persons who have
19 characteristics similar to those of a victim of the offender. Upon request, law

21 low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk offenders.
22 15. A state officer, law enforcement agency, or public school district or governing body of a

26 disclose information as permitted by this section.
27 16. If a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent and required or ordered to register as a sexual
28 offender or as an offender against a child under this section, the juvenile shall comply
29 with the registration requirements in this section. Notwithstanding any other provision

1 other law enforcement agencies, the department of health and human services, or the
2 public if disclosure is necessary to protect public health or safety. The law enforcement
3 agency shall release any relevant and necessary information on file to the

5 administration shall notify others in similar positions if the juvenile transfers to another
6 learning institution in or outside the state.

11 court shall comply with the requirements of this section.
12 18. A sexual offender who is currently assigned a moderate or high-risk level by the
13 attorney general may not use a state park of this state as a residence or residential

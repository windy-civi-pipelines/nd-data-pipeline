BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 57-51-02.6 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
57-51-02.6. Temporary exemption for oil and gas wells employing a system to avoid flaring.
Gas is exempt from the tax under section 57-51-02.2 for a period of two years and thirty days from
the time of first production if the gas is:
1. Collected and used at the well site to power an electrical generator that consumes at least
seventy-five percent of the gas from the well; or
2. Collected at the well site by a system that intakes at least seventy-five percent of the gas and
natural gas liquids volume from the well for beneficial consumption by means of compression
to liquid for use as fuel, transport to a processing facility, production of petrochemicals or
fertilizer, conversion to liquid fuels, separating and collecting over fifty percent of the propane
and heavier hydrocarbons, or other value-added processes as approved by the industrial
commission.
SECTION 2. AMENDMENT. Section 57-51-05 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
57-51-05. Payment of tax on monthly basis - When tax due - When delinquent - Payment by
purchaser - By producer - How casinghead gas taxed - Exemptions.
1. The gross production tax on oil or gas, as herein provided, must be paid on a monthly basis.
The tax on oil is due and payable on the twenty-fifth day of the month succeeding the month of
production. The tax on gas is due and payable on the fifteenth day of the second month
succeeding the month of production. If the tax is not paid as required by this section, it
becomes delinquent and must be collected as provided in this chapter. The penalty does not
apply if ninety percent of the tax due has been paid with the monthly return and the taxpayer
files an amended monthly return and pays the total tax due within sixty days from the original
due date. The commissioner, upon request and a proper showing of the necessity thereforfor
an extension, may grant an extension of time, not to exceed fifteen days, for paying the tax
and when the request is granted the tax is not delinquent until the extended period has
expired. Any taxpayer who requests and is granted an extension of time for filing a return shall
pay, with the tax, interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date the tax was
due to the date the tax is paid.
2. On oil or gas produced and sold, the gross production tax thereon must be paid by the
purchaser, and the purchaser is authorized to deduct in making settlement with the producer

S. B. NO. 2397 - PAGE 2
or royalty owner, the amount of tax paid; provided, that in the event oil produced is not sold but
is retained by the producer, the tax on the oil not sold must be paid by the producer, including
the tax due on royalty oil not sold; provided further, that in settlement with the royalty owner
the producer has the right to deduct the amount of the tax paid on royalty oil or to deduct
therefrom royalty oil equivalent in value at the time the tax becomes due with the amount of
the tax paid.
3. Gas when produced and utilized in any manner, except when used for fuel or otherwise used
in the operation of any lease or premises in the drilling for or production of oil or gas
therefrom, or for repressuring thereon, must be considered for the purpose of this chapter, as
to the amount utilized, as gas actually produced and saved, except gas:
a. Used for fuel or otherwise used in the operation of any lease or premises in the drilling
for or production of oil or gas from the lease or premises, including repressuring on the
lease or premises; and
b. Produced from an enhanced oil recovery project utilizing the injection of gas, either alone
or in combination with other fluids, for the purpose of testing the feasibility of enhanced
oil recovery operations on a temporary basis for one or more spacing units or employing
enhanced oil recovery operations for an extended or indefinite period of time on a
fieldwide basis through unitization of the reservoir that produces oil and gas. The
exemption under this subdivision applies to all enhanced oil recovery projects created
and established by the industrial commission after June 30, 2025, and for any gas
produced after the date of first production following initial injection of gas until all gas
injected as part of the enhanced oil recovery project has been recovered from the
reservoir being tested or unitized.
4. All calculations of the gross production tax on oil or gas, including production, distribution, and
claims for credit or refund, are based on the month of production and must be credited to that
month.
SECTION 3. AMENDMENT. Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
57-51.1-01. Definitions for oil extraction tax.
For the purposes of this chapter:
1. "Average daily production" of a well means the qualified maximum total production of oil from
the well during a calendar month period divided by the number of calendar days in that period,
and "qualified maximum total production" of a well means that the well must have been
maintained at the maximum efficient rate of production as defined and determined by rule
adopted by the industrial commission in furtherance of its authority under chapter 38-08.
2. "Development incentive well" means, as determined and certified by the industrial
commission, a well spud after June 30, 2025, which :
a. Utilizes a new or innovative drilling or completion technique that constitutes a technical
advancement that has not been previously utilized with demonstrated success by the
operator within the specific formation targeted for development by that operator;
b. Demonstrates the capability to develop reserves within the target formation that would
otherwise remain underdeveloped or undeveloped under existing drilling or completion
techniques; and
c. Is designed and anticipated to, more likely than not, increase the number of new wells,
additional production, or the ultimate recovery of oil or gas within the target formation.

S. B. NO. 2397 - PAGE 3
3. "Horizontal well" means a well with a horizontal displacement of the well bore drilled at an
angle of at least eighty degrees within the productive formation of at least three hundred feet
[91.44 meters].
3.4. "Oil" means petroleum, crude oil, mineral oil, casinghead gasoline, and all liquid hydrocarbons
that are recovered from gas on the lease incidental to the production of the gas.
4.5. "Property" means the right which arises from a lease or fee interest, as a whole or any
designated portion thereof, to produce oil. A producer shall treat as a separate property each
separate and distinct producing reservoir subject to the same right to produce crude oil;
provided, that such reservoir is recognized by the industrial commission as a producing
formation that is separate and distinct from, and not in communication with, any other
producing formation.

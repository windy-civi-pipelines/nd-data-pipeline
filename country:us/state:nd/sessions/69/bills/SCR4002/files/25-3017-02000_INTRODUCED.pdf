Introduced by
Senators Conley, Hogue, Thomas, Wanzek
Representatives Headland, Lefor
1 A concurrent resolution urging Congress to enact legislation allowing a landowner to terminate a
2 perpetual easement owned by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service within the state.
3 WHEREAS, the Constitution of North Dakota provides all individuals are by nature equally
4 free and independent and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of acquiring,
5 possessing, and protecting property and reputation; and
6 WHEREAS, Section 47-05-02.1 of the North Dakota Century Code is evidence of the
7 state's strong aversion to perpetual easements on real property in the state; and
8 WHEREAS, despite the law limiting perpetual easements, the United States Fish and
9 Wildlife Service owns tens of thousands of perpetual easements in the state covering more than
10 one million acres, many of which are located on agricultural land; and
11 WHEREAS, under these perpetual easements, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
12 enforces unduly burdensome federal regulations and requirements; and
13 WHEREAS, the imposition and enforcement of these federal requirements negatively
14 infringes on basic private property rights, including the ability to drain ponds, plant crops, and
15 conduct ranching operations; and
16 WHEREAS, landowners subject to these perpetual easements should be afforded the
17 opportunity to terminate the easements by paying to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
18 the purchase price of the easement on the effective date of the easement;

20 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN:
21 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges Congress to enact legislation allowing a
22 landowner to terminate a perpetual easement owned by the United States Fish and Wildlife
23 Service within the state; and

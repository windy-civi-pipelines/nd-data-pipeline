In Regular Session Commencing Tuesday, January 7, 2025
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4013
(Senators Sickler, Erbele, Klein, Meyer)
(Representative Bahl)
A concurrent resolution to support the electoral college, denounce the National Popular Vote Interstate
Compact, and invite interested states to form the Electoral College Interstate Compact.
WHEREAS, the electoral college system respects states as the essential units in our federal
republic, protecting states' power and voice in presidential elections; and
WHEREAS, the electoral college system creates an appropriate balance between rural and urban
interests and ensures the winning candidate has support from multiple regions of the country; and
WHEREAS, the electoral college system ensures each state's electoral votes are awarded based
on how the state's citizens vote; and
WHEREAS, the nation's founders' rejected a national popular vote for president and instead
created the Electoral College; and
WHEREAS, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact diminishes the importance of individual
states in presidential elections, creates the potential for nationwide recounts, and opens the door to
greater federal control of elections; and
WHEREAS, the constitutionality of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is doubtful
because it appears to violate the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution and the intent of the
electoral college clauses;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF NORTH DAKOTA, THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly supports the Electoral College and believes the National
Popular Vote Interstate Compact may be unconstitutional; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in response to the creation of the National Popular Vote Interstate
Compact, North Dakota and all other interested states should consider forming an Electoral College
Interstate Compact, which would prohibit requiring state electors to cast electoral college votes in
accordance with the national popular vote count for President and require the compact states to legally
challenge the constitutionality of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, this state proposes forming the Electoral College Interstate
Compact when four other states declare intent to form the Electoral College Interstate Compact, at
which time the interested states shall take appropriate steps to organize and form the compact; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution to the
Secretaries of State and majority and minority leaders in each legislative chamber in the states of
Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

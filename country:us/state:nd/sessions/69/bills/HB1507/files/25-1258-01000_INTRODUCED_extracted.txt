22 institution, is providing services to the investment company or trust as investment
23 advisor, sponsor, broker, distributor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, or otherwise
24 and receiving compensation for the services does not preclude the trustee from
25 investing in the securities of that investment company or trust. The banking institution
26 and trust shall disclose to all current income beneficiaries of the trust the rate, formula,
27 and method of the compensation, and the relationship of ownership. No compensation
28 or commission paid or agreed to be paid to it for the negotiation of a loan or the
29 execution of a trust may be deemed interest within the meaning of the law, nor may
30 any excess thereof over the legal rate be deemed usury.

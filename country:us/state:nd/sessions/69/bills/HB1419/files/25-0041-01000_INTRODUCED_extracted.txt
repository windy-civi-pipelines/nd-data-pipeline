28 except for supreme and district court judges, who must have completed five years of
29 eligible employment, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the

Page No. 16 25.0041.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 board shall pay the member's account balance to the named beneficiary. If the
2 member has named more than one primary beneficiary, the board shall pay the
3 member's account balance to the named primary beneficiaries in the percentages
4 designated by the member or, if the member has not designated a percentage for the
5 beneficiaries, in equal percentages. If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has
6 predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to
7 the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies
8 before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the
9 beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
10 the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in
11 the same manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall
12 pay the member's account balance to the member's estate. If the member has not
13 designated an alternate beneficiary or the surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the
14 surviving spouse of the member may select a form of payment as follows:
15 a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may
16 select one of the following optional forms of payment:
17 (1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of
18 death.
19 (2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of
20 normal retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.
21 b. The surviving spouse of all other members may select one of the following
22 options:
23 (1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of
24 death.
25 (2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the
26 deceased member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse
27 dies.
28 (3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the
29 payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have
30 been paid to the surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of
31 the member's death and had selected a one hundred percent joint and
Page No. 17 25.0041.01000
Sixty-ninth

1 survivor annuity, payable until the spouse dies. A surviving spouse who
2 received a benefit under this subsection as of July 31, 1995, is entitled to
3 the higher of that person's existing benefit or the equivalent of the accrued
4 benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and survivor provision
5 as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with the increase
6 payable beginning August 1, 1995.
7 7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment
8 because of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary
9 reason prior to retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is
10 entitled to the member's account balance at termination. The board automatically shall
11 refund a member's account balance if the member has completed less than three
12 years of eligible employment, has an account balance of less than one thousand
13 dollars, and was not a supreme or district court judge. If the member was a supreme
14 or district court judge, the board automatically shall refund a member's account
15 balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible employment. A
16 member may waive the refund if the member submits a written statement to the board,
17 within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's account balance
18 remain in the fund.
19 8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the
20 member's primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving
21 spouse designates an alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement
22 benefits or the member's surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before
23 the total amount of benefits paid to either or both equals the amount of the member's
24 account balance at retirement, the difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of
25 the recipient or, if there is no named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit
26 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
27 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
28 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
29 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.
30 9. The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the
31 following optional forms:

11 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life
12 benefit. For supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests

15 pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, if
16 any.
17 10. The fund may accept rollovers from other eligible plans under rules adopted by the
18 board for the purchase of additional service credit, but only to the extent the transfer is
19 a rollover contribution that meets the requirement of section 408 of the Internal
20 Revenue Code.
21 11. The board may accept trustee-to-trustee transfers as permitted by Internal Revenue
22 Code section 403(b)(13) and section 457(e)(17) from an Internal Revenue Code
23 section 403(b) annuity or Internal Revenue Code section 457 deferred compensation

1 board shall pay the member's account balance to the named beneficiary. If the
2 member has named more than one primary beneficiary, the board shall pay the
3 member's account balance to the named primary beneficiaries in the percentages

6 predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to
7 the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies
8 before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the
9 beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
10 the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in
11 the same manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall

2 received a benefit under this subsection as of July 31, 1995, is entitled to
3 the higher of that person's existing benefit or the equivalent of the accrued
4 benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and survivor provision
5 as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with the increase
6 payable beginning August 1, 1995.
7 7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment
8 because of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary
9 reason prior to retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is

11 refund a member's account balance if the member has completed less than three
12 years of eligible employment, has an account balance of less than one thousand
13 dollars, and was not a supreme or district court judge. If the member was a supreme
14 or district court judge, the board automatically shall refund a member's account
15 balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible employment. A

18 remain in the fund.
19 8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the
20 member's primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving
21 spouse designates an alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement
22 benefits or the member's surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before
23 the total amount of benefits paid to either or both equals the amount of the member's
24 account balance at retirement, the difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of
25 the recipient or, if there is no named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit
26 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
27 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
28 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
29 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.

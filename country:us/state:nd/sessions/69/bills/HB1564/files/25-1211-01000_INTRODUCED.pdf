22 purposes of involuntary foster care placement or the termination of parental rights over
23 an Indian child, the court shall find that active efforts have been made to provide
24 remedial services and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the breakup of the
25 Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may not
26 order the removal unless evidence of active efforts shows there has been a vigorous
27 and concerted level of casework beyond the level that would constitute reasonable
28 efforts under section 27-20.3-26. Reasonable efforts may not be construed to be
29 active efforts. Active efforts must be made in a manner that takes into account the

31 tribe. Active efforts must utilize the available resources of the Indian child's extended
Page No. 4 25.1211.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 family, tribe, tribal and other relevant social service agencies, and individual Indian
2 caregivers.
3 3. The court may order the removal of the Indian child for involuntary foster care
4 placement only if the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that
5 continued custody of the Indian child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to
6 result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child. Evidence must
7 show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the
8 likelihood that continued custody of the Indian child will result in serious emotional or
9 physical damage to the particular Indian child who is the subject of the proceeding.
10 Poverty, isolation, custodian age, crowded or inadequate housing, substance use, or
11 nonconforming social behavior does not by itself constitute clear and convincing
12 evidence of imminent serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child. As
13 soon as the threat has been removed and the Indian child is no longer at risk, the state
14 should terminate the removal, by returning the Indian child to the parent or Indian
15 custodian while offering a solution to mitigate the situation that gave rise to the need
16 for emergency removal and placement.If a court order authorizes the emergency
17 removal of the Indian child from the parent or Indian custodian of the child under this
18 section, the order must be accompanied by a declaration that includes:
19 a. The name, tribal affiliation, and address of the Indian child, each parent of the
20 Indian child, and the Indian custodian of the child, as applicable; and
21 b. A detailed account of the circumstances that led the agency responsible for
22 emergency removal of the child to take that action.
23 4. The court may order the termination of parental rights over the Indian child only if the
24 court determines, by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of
25 the Indian child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional
26 or physical damage to the Indian child.
27 5. In considering whether to involuntarily place an Indian child in foster care or to
28 terminate the parental rights of the parent of an Indian child, the court shall require that
29 a qualified expert witness must be qualified to testify regarding whether the Indian
30 child's continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious
31 emotional or physical damage to the Indian child and should be qualified to testify as
Page No. 5 25.1211.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's tribe. An individual
2 may be designated by the Indian child's tribe as being qualified to testify to the
3 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's tribe. If the parties
4 stipulate in writing and the court is satisfied the stipulation is made knowingly,
5 intelligently, and voluntarily, the court may accept a declaration or affidavit from a
6 qualified expert witness in lieu of testimony. If one or more parties have been found to
7 be in default under the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may accept a
8 declaration or affidavit from a qualified expert witness without a stipulation in writing
9 from the defaulted parties. The court or any party may request the assistance of the
10 Indian child's tribe or the bureau of Indian affairs office serving the Indian child's tribe
11 in locating individuals qualified to serve as expert witnesses. The social worker
12 regularly assigned to the Indian child may not serve as a qualified expert witness in
13 child custody proceedings concerning the Indian child. The qualified expert witness
14 should be someone familiar with the particular Indian child and have contact with the
15 parent or Indian custodian to observe interaction between the parent or Indian
16 custodian, Indian child, and extended family members. The child welfare agency and
17 courts should facilitate access to the family and records to facilitate accurate
18 testimony.
19 6. An emergency removal or placement of an Indian child under state law must terminate
20 immediately when the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent
21 imminent physical damage or harm to the Indian child. If removal or placement is
22 determined to be no longer necessary, the child welfare agency shall terminate the
23 removal by returning the Indian child to the parent or Indian custodian and offer a
24 solution to mitigate the situation that gave rise to the need for emergency removal and
25 placement.
26 7. If an Indian child is the subject of a shelter care hearing, the party initiating the hearing
27 shall provide the court with a declaration that includes the specific actions that have
28 been taken to assist the parent or Indian custodian since the emergency removal so
29 the child may be safely returned to the custody of the parent or Indian custodian, and
30 the specific actions the initiating party intends to take so the Indian child may be
31 returned safely without initiating an Indian child custody proceeding.

1 8. To facilitate the intent of this chapter, the agency, in cooperation with the Indian child's
2 tribe of affiliation, unless a parent objects, shall take steps to enroll the Indian child in
3 the tribe with the goal of finalizing enrollment before termination.

7 1. This chapter includes requirements that apply if an Indian child is the subject of:
8 a. A child custody proceeding, including:
9 (1) An involuntary proceeding; and
10 (2) A voluntary proceeding that could prohibit the parent or Indian custodian
11 from regaining custody of the Indian child upon demand; and
12 (3) A proceeding involving status offenses if any part of the proceeding results
13 in the need for out-of-home placement of the child, including a foster care,
14 preadoptive or adoptive placement, or termination of parental rights.
15 b. An emergency proceeding other than:
16 (1) A tribal.
17 2. This chapter does not apply to:
18 a. A tribal court proceeding; or
19 (2)b. A proceeding regarding a delinquent act;
20 c. An award of custody of the Indian child to one of the parents, including an award
21 in a divorce proceeding; or
22 d. A voluntary placement that either parent, both parents, or the Indian custodian
23 has, of his or her or their free will, without a threat of removal by a state agency,
24 chosen for the Indian child and that does not operate to prohibit the Indian child's
25 parent or Indian custodian from regaining custody of the Indian child upon
26 demand.
27 2.3. If a proceeding under subsection 1 concerns an Indian child, this chapter applies to
28 that proceeding. In determining whether this chapter applies to a proceeding, the state
29 court may not consider factors such as the participation of a parent or the Indian child
30 in tribal cultural, social, religious, or political activities; the relationship between the
Page No. 7 25.1211.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 Indian child and the Indian child's parent; whether the parent ever had custody of the
2 Indian child; or the Indian child's blood quantum.
3 3.4. If this chapter applies at the commencement of a proceeding, this chapter does not
4 cease to apply solely because the Indian child reaches age eighteen during the
5 pendency of the proceeding.
6 4.5. In an Indian child custody proceeding under this chapter involving an Indian child who
7 is not residing or domiciled within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court
8 assigned to exercise jurisdiction under this chapter, upon the petition of the Indian
9 child's parent, Indian custodian, or tribe, shall transfer the proceeding to the
10 jurisdiction of the tribe unless eitherany of the following appliesapply:
11 a. A parent of the Indian child objects to the transfer.
12 b. An Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over an Indian child custody proceeding
13 involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of the
14 tribe, except if that jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the state by federal law. If an
15 Indian child is a ward of a tribal court, the Indian tribe retains exclusive
16 jurisdiction regardless of the residence or domicile of the Indian child.
17 5. In an Indian child custody proceeding under this chapter involving an Indian child who
18 is not residing or domiciled within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court
19 assigned to exercise jurisdiction under this chapter, upon the petition of the Indian
20 child's parent, Indian custodian, or tribe, shall transfer the proceeding to the
21 jurisdiction of the tribe unless any of the following apply:
22 a. A parent of the Indian child objects to the transfer.
23 b.c. The Indian child's tribe does not have a tribal court, or the tribal court of the
24 Indian child's tribe declines jurisdiction.
25 c.d. The court determines good cause exists to deny the transfer. In determining
26 whether good cause exists to deny the transfer, the court may not consider any
27 perceived inadequacy of the tribal social services department or the tribal court of
28 the Indian child's tribe. The court may determine good cause exists to deny the
29 transfer only if the person opposing the transfer shows by clear and convincing
30 evidence the evidence or testimony necessary to decide the case cannot be
31 presented in tribal court without undue hardship to the parties or the witnesses

1 and that the tribal court is unable to mitigate the hardship by making
2 arrangements to receive the evidence or testimony by use of telephone or live
3 audiovisual means, by hearing the evidence or testimony at a location that is
4 convenient to the parties and witnesses, or by use of other means permissible
5 under the tribal court's rules of evidence.
6 6. An Indian child's tribe may intervene at any point in an Indian child custody
7 proceeding.
8 7. The state shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial
9 proceedings of an Indian tribe which are applicable to an Indian child custody
10 proceeding to the same extent that the state gives full faith and credit to the public
11 acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any other governmental entity.
12 SECTION 3. AMENDMENT. Subsection 1 of section 27-19.1-03 of the North Dakota
13 Century Code is amended and reenacted as follows:
14 1. In a proceeding involving the foster care or nonfoster care placement of or termination
15 of parental rights to an Indian child whom the court knows or has reason to know may
16 be an Indian child, the party seeking the foster care or nonfoster care placement or
17 termination of parental rights, for the first hearing of the proceeding, shall notify the
18 Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, and tribe, by registered mail, return receipt

22 delivery, facsimile transmission, or electronic mail. If the identity or location of the
23 Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or tribe cannot be determined, that notice shall
24 be given to the United States secretary of the interior in like manner. The first hearing
25 in the proceeding may not be held until at least ten days after receipt of the notice by
26 the parent, Indian custodian, and tribe or until at least fifteen days after receipt of the
27 notice by the United States secretary of the interior. On request of the parent, Indian
28 custodian, or tribe, the court shall grant a continuance of up to twenty additional days

15 child custody determination under section 27-20.3-06 must be placed in compliance

21 placed in compliance with the order of placement preference under subsection 2.
22 4. In placing an Indian child under subsections 1 and 2 regarding an Indian child under
23 subsection 1, if the Indian child's tribe has established, by resolution, an order of

25 preference established by that tribe must be followed, in the absence of good cause,
26 as described in subsection 6, to the contrary, so long as the placement under

2 members reside or with which the Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or extended
3 family members maintain social and cultural ties.
4 6. a. If a party asserts that good cause not to follow the placement preferences exists,
5 the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or
6 provided in writing to the parties to the child custody proceeding and the court.
7 b. The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of
8 proving by clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from

10 c. A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences
11 must be made on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of
12 the following considerations:
13 (1) The request of the Indian child's parent, if they attest that they have
14 reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of
15 preference.
16 (2) The request of the Indian child, if the Indian child is of sufficient age and
17 capacity to understand the decision being made.
18 (3) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a
19 particular placement.
20 (4) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child,

23 (5) The unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court
24 that a diligent search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting
25 the preference criteria, but none has been located. For purposes of this
26 analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
27 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian
28 community in which the Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or extended
29 family resides or with which the Indian child's parent, Indian custodian, or
30 extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.

12 that record available at any time on the request of the United States secretary of the
13 interior or the Indian child's tribe.

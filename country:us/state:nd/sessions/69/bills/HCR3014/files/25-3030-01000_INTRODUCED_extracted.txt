1 A concurrent resolution urging public health, health care systems, and health care providers to
2 prioritize primary prevention in addressing vitamin D deficiency through multifaceted precision
3 public health and medicine approaches.
4 WHEREAS, vitamin D is generated primarily from the sun and research demonstrates the
5 need for regional sun exposure and vitamin D recommendations to offset individual and
6 population health risk factors for disease; and
7 WHEREAS, North Dakota is located at a latitude of 48 degrees and has an ultraviolet index
8 of less than three for up to 6 months of the year due to the solar zenith, from October to April,
9 which limits the vitamin D generating potential from sun exposure; and
10 WHEREAS, this environmental determinant of health puts all residents of the state at risk
11 for vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency compared to citizens of the United States in southern
12 latitudes, potentially leading to suboptimal health outcomes and increased health care costs for
13 residents; and
14 WHEREAS, research indicates it is difficult to achieve the daily recommended intake of
15 vitamin D from foods alone and there is a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and
16 all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and many
17 types of cancer, including breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers; and
18 WHEREAS, research indicates an association between vitamin D deficiency and emotional
19 regulation, mental health conditions including Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia,
20 suicide and suicidal ideation, depression, and opioid addiction; and
21 WHEREAS, research indicates an association between vitamin D deficiency and
22 autoimmune disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke;
23 WHEREAS, research indicates adequate vitamin D intake results in improved prenatal and
24 neonatal outcomes, including reducing the risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and
25 preterm birth; and

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, research indicates women with 25(OH)D serum concentrations equal to or
2 greater than 60 nanograms per milliliter had an 80 percent lower risk of breast cancer than
3 women with concentrations of less than 20 nanograms per millileter; and
4 WHEREAS, research indicates vitamin D supplementation and sensible sun exposure
5 safely and effectively increase vitamin D serum concentrations; and
6 WHEREAS, the Legislative Assembly advocates for statewide educational campaigns
7 aimed at increasing awareness of vitamin D deficiency; its risks; the importance of adequate
8 vitamin D levels, particularly for pregnant individuals, children, and those with mental health
9 concerns; and other heightened risk factors for the public and health care professionals;
10 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
11 NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
12 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges North Dakota public health, health care
13 systems, and health care providers to prioritize primary prevention in addressing vitamin D
14 deficiency through multifaceted precision public health and medicine approaches that recognize
15 both regional and individual determinants of health in diverse populations across the lifespan to
16 improve patient outcomes, population health, and decrease overall health care costs; and
17 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges the State
18 Health Officer to publish this resolution on the official website of the department of health and
19 human services; and
20 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution
21 to the State Health Officer, North Dakota public health units, American Hospital Association,
22 North Dakota Long Term Care Association, North Dakota Medical Association, North Dakota
23 Nurses Association, North Dakota Nurse Practitioner Association, North Dakota University
24 System institutions of higher education, North Dakota private universities, and the North Dakota
25 Department of Public Instruction.

Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota
In Regular Session Commencing Tuesday, January 7, 2025
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3014
(Representatives Rohr, K. Anderson, Dobervich, Frelich, McLeod, Meier, M. Ruby)
(Senators Dwyer, Hogue, Myrdal)
A concurrent resolution urging public health, health care systems, and health care providers to prioritize
primary prevention in addressing vitamin D deficiency through multifaceted precision public
health and medicine approaches.
WHEREAS, vitamin D is generated primarily from the sun and research demonstrates the need for
regional sun exposure and vitamin D recommendations to offset individual and population health risk
factors for disease; and
WHEREAS, North Dakota is located at a latitude of 48 degrees and has an ultraviolet index of less
than three for up to 6 months of the year due to the solar zenith, from October to April, which limits the
vitamin D generating potential from sun exposure; and
WHEREAS, this environmental determinant of health puts all residents of the state at risk for
vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency compared to citizens of the United States in southern latitudes,
potentially leading to suboptimal health outcomes and increased health care costs for residents; and
WHEREAS, research indicates it is difficult to achieve the daily recommended intake of vitamin D
from foods alone and there is a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and all cause
mortality, cardiovascular disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and many types of cancer,
including breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers; and
WHEREAS, research indicates an association between vitamin D deficiency and emotional
regulation, mental health conditions including Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, suicide
and suicidal ideation, depression, and opioid addiction; and
WHEREAS, research indicates an association between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune
disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke;
WHEREAS, research indicates adequate vitamin D intake results in improved prenatal and
neonatal outcomes, including reducing the risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm
birth; and
WHEREAS, research indicates women with 25(OH)D serum concentrations equal to or greater
than 60 nanograms per milliliter had an 80 percent lower risk of breast cancer than women with
concentrations of less than 20 nanograms per millileter; and
WHEREAS, research indicates vitamin D supplementation and sensible sun exposure safely and
effectively increase vitamin D serum concentrations; and
WHEREAS, the Legislative Assembly advocates for statewide educational campaigns aimed at
increasing awareness of vitamin D deficiency; its risks; the importance of adequate vitamin D levels,
particularly for pregnant individuals, children, and those with mental health concerns; and other
heightened risk factors for the public and health care professionals;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NORTH
DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges North Dakota public health, health care systems,
and health care providers to prioritize primary prevention in addressing vitamin D deficiency through
multifaceted precision public health and medicine approaches that recognize both regional and

individual determinants of health in diverse populations across the lifespan to improve patient
outcomes, population health, and decrease overall health care costs; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges the State Health
Officer to publish this resolution on the official website of the department of health and human services;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution to the
State Health Officer, North Dakota public health units, American Hospital Association, North Dakota
Long Term Care Association, North Dakota Medical Association, North Dakota Nurses Association,
North Dakota Nurse Practitioner Association, North Dakota University System institutions of higher
education, North Dakota private universities, and the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.

13 differing substantially from the estimate provided by the county director of tax
14 equalization, written evidence to support the change must be provided to the county
15 director of tax equalization. In determining the relative value of each assessment
16 parcel, the local assessor shall apply the following considerations, which are listed in

18 a. Actual use of the property for cropland or noncropland purposes by the owner of
19 the parcel.
20 b. Soil type and soil classification data from detailed or general soil surveys.

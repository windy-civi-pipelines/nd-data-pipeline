4 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
5 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
6 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
7 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.

23 permanently and totally disabled, according to medical evidence called for under
24 the rules of the board, and has completed at least one hundred eighty days of
25 eligible employment. For supreme and district court judges, permanent and total
26 disability is based solely on a judge's inability to perform judicial duties arising out
27 of physical or mental impairment, as determined pursuant to rules adopted by the

5 f.e. Early retirement benefits are calculated as for single life benefits accrued to the
6 date of termination of employment, but must be actuarially reduced to account for
7 benefit payments beginning before the normal retirement date, as determined

9 firefighter, peace officer, or correctional officer employed by a political
10 subdivision, a peace officer or correctional officer employed by the statea
11 governmental unit, or a supreme court or district court judge, early retirement
12 benefits for members first enrolled after December 31, 2015, are calculated for

25 disability retirement benefit under this section is one hundred dollars.
26 5. Upon termination of employment after completing three years of eligible employment,
27 except for supreme and district court judges, who must complete five years of eligible
28 employment, but before normal retirement date, a member who does not elect to
29 receive early retirement benefits is eligible to receive deferred vested retirement
30 benefits payable commencing on the member's normal retirement date in one of the

2 may choose to receive either a lump sum payment equal to the amount of missed
3 payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the member has selected,
4 which increase must reflect the missed payments.
5 6. If before retiring a member dies after completing three years of eligible employment,
6 except for supreme and district court judges, who must have completed five years of
7 eligible employment, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the
8 member's designated beneficiary as provided in this subsection. If the member has
9 designated an alternate beneficiary with the surviving spouse's written consent, the
10 board shall pay the member's account balance to the named beneficiary. If the
11 member has named more than one primary beneficiary, the board shall pay the
12 member's account balance to the named primary beneficiaries in the percentages
13 designated by the member or, if the member has not designated a percentage for the
14 beneficiaries, in equal percentages. If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has
15 predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to
16 the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies
17 before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the
18 beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
19 the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in
20 the same manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall
21 pay the member's account balance to the member's estate. If the member has not
22 designated an alternate beneficiary or the surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the
23 surviving spouse of the member may select a form of payment as follows:
24 a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may
25 select one of the following optional forms of payment:
26 (1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of
27 death.
28 (2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of
29 normal retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.

3 (2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the
4 deceased member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse
5 dies.
6 (3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the
7 payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have
8 been paid to the surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of
9 the member's death and had selected a one hundred percent joint and
10 survivor annuity, payable until the spouse dies. A surviving spouse who
11 received a benefit under this subsection as of July 31, 1995, is entitled to
12 the higher of that person's existing benefit or the equivalent of the accrued
13 benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and survivor provision
14 as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with the increase
15 payable beginning August 1, 1995.
16 7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment
17 because of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary
18 reason prior to retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is
19 entitled to the member's account balance at termination. The board automatically shall
20 refund a member's account balance if the member has completed less than three
21 years of eligible employment, has an account balance of less than one thousand
22 dollars, and was not a supreme or district court judge. If the member was a supreme
23 or district court judge, the board automatically shall refund a member's account
24 balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible employment. A
25 member may waive the refund if the member submits a written statement to the board,
26 within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's account balance
27 remain in the fund.
28 8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the
29 member's primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving
30 spouse designates an alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement
31 benefits or the member's surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before
Page No. 15 25.0040.02000

Sixty-ninth

1 the total amount of benefits paid to either or both equals the amount of the member's
2 account balance at retirement, the difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of
3 the recipient or, if there is no named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit
4 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
5 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
6 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
7 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.
8 9. The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the
9 following optional forms:
10 a. Single life.
11 b. An actuarially equivalent joint and survivor option, with fifty percent or one
12 hundred percent options.

15 maximum lump sum distribution.

18 Except for supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests
19 that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time of
20 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life
21 benefit. For supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests
22 that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time of
23 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a lifetime monthly
24 pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, if
25 any.
26 10. The fund may accept rollovers from other eligible plans under rules adopted by the
27 board for the purchase of additional service credit, but only to the extent the transfer is

6 benefits or the member's surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before
7 the total amount of benefits paid to either or both equals the amount of the member's
8 account balance at retirement, the difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of
9 the recipient or, if there is no named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit
10 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
11 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
12 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
13 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.

26 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life
27 benefit. For supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests

2 except for supreme and district court judges, who must complete five years of eligible
3 employment, but before normal retirement date, a member who does not elect to
4 receive early retirement benefits is eligible to receive deferred vested retirement
5 benefits payable commencing on the member's normal retirement date in one of the
6 optional forms provided in subsection 9. Members who have delayed or inadvertently
7 failed to apply for retirement benefits to commence on their normal retirement date
8 may choose to receive either a lump sum payment equal to the amount of missed
9 payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the member has selected,
10 which increase must reflect the missed payments.
11 6. If before retiring a member dies after completing three years of eligible employment,
12 except for supreme and district court judges, who must have completed five years of
13 eligible employment, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the
14 member's designated beneficiary as provided in this subsection. If the member has
15 designated an alternate beneficiary with the surviving spouse's written consent, the
16 board shall pay the member's account balance to the named beneficiary. If the
17 member has named more than one primary beneficiary, the board shall pay the
18 member's account balance to the named primary beneficiaries in the percentages
19 designated by the member or, if the member has not designated a percentage for the
20 beneficiaries, in equal percentages. If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has
21 predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to
22 the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies
23 before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the
24 beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
25 the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in
26 the same manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall
27 pay the member's account balance to the member's estate. If the member has not
28 designated an alternate beneficiary or the surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the
29 surviving spouse of the member may select a form of payment as follows:
30 a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may
31 select one of the following optional forms of payment:

1 (1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of
2 death.
3 (2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of
4 normal retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.
5 b. The surviving spouse of all other members may select one of the following
6 options:
7 (1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of
8 death.
9 (2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the
10 deceased member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse
11 dies.
12 (3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the
13 payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have
14 been paid to the surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of
15 the member's death and had selected a one hundred percent joint and
16 survivor annuity, payable until the spouse dies. A surviving spouse who
17 received a benefit under this subsection as of July 31, 1995, is entitled to
18 the higher of that person's existing benefit or the equivalent of the accrued
19 benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and survivor provision
20 as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with the increase
21 payable beginning August 1, 1995.
22 7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment
23 because of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary
24 reason prior to retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is
25 entitled to the member's account balance at termination. The board automatically shall
26 refund a member's account balance if the member has completed less than three
27 years of eligible employment, has an account balance of less than one thousand
28 dollars, and was not a supreme or district court judge. If the member was a supreme
29 or district court judge, the board automatically shall refund a member's account
30 balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible employment. A
31 member may waive the refund if the member submits a written statement to the board,

1 within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's account balance
2 remain in the fund.
3 8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the
4 member's primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving
5 spouse designates an alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement
6 benefits or the member's surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before
7 the total amount of benefits paid to either or both equals the amount of the member's
8 account balance at retirement, the difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of
9 the recipient or, if there is no named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit
10 payment owed to the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary which was
11 not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse, or alternate beneficiary
12 must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
13 beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.
14 9. The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the
15 following optional forms:
16 a. Single life.
17 b. An actuarially equivalent joint and survivor option, with fifty percent or one
18 hundred percent options.
19 c. Actuarially equivalent life with ten-year or twenty-year certain options.
20 d. An actuarially equivalent partial lump sum distribution option with a twelve-month
21 maximum lump sum distribution.
22 e. An actuarially equivalent graduated benefit option with either a one percent or
23 two percent increase to be applied the first day of January of each year.
24 Except for supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests
25 that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time of
26 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life
27 benefit. For supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests
28 that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time of
29 applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a lifetime monthly
30 pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, if
31 any.

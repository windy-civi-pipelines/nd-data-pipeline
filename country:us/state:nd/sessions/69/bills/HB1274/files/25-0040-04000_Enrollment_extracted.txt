officer, or correctional officer employed by a political subdivision, a peace officer or

member's normal retirement date in one of the optional forms provided in subsection 9.
Members who have delayed or inadvertently failed to apply for retirement benefits to
commence on their normal retirement date may choose to receive either a lump sum payment
equal to the amount of missed payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the
member has selected, which increase must reflect the missed payments.

Section 45:

supreme and district court judges, who must have completed five years of eligible
employment, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the member's designated
beneficiary as provided in this subsection. If the member has designated an alternate
beneficiary with the surviving spouse's written consent, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the named beneficiary. If the member has named more than one primary
beneficiary, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the named primary
beneficiaries in the percentages designated by the member or, if the member has not
designated a percentage for the beneficiaries, in equal percentages. If one or more of the
primary beneficiaries has predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased
beneficiary's share to the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the
member, yet dies before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated
as if the beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in the same
manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the member's estate. If the member has not designated an alternate
beneficiary or the surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the surviving spouse of the member may
select a form of payment as follows:
a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may select one
of the following optional forms of payment:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of normal
retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.
b. The surviving spouse of all other members may select one of the following options:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the deceased
member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse dies.
(3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the payment of
a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have been paid to the
H. B. NO. 1274 - PAGE 10
surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of the member's death and
had selected a one hundred percent joint and survivor annuity, payable until the
spouse dies. A surviving spouse who received a benefit under this subsection as of
July 31, 1995, is entitled to the higher of that person's existing benefit or the
equivalent of the accrued benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and
survivor provision as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with
the increase payable beginning August 1, 1995.

Section 46:

of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary reason prior to

account balance at termination. The board automatically shall refund a member's account
balance if the member has completed less than three years of eligible employment, has an
account balance of less than one thousand dollars, and was not a supreme or district court
judge. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the board automatically shall
refund a member's account balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible
employment. A member may waive the refund if the member submits a written statement to
the board, within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's account balance
remain in the fund.

Section 47:
8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the member's
primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse designates an
alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement benefits or the member's
surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before the total amount of benefits paid to
either or both equals the amount of the member's account balance at retirement, the
difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit payment owed to the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary which was not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no

officer, or correctional officer employed by a political subdivision, a peace officer or

Members who have delayed or inadvertently failed to apply for retirement benefits to
commence on their normal retirement date may choose to receive either a lump sum payment
equal to the amount of missed payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the
member has selected, which increase must reflect the missed payments.
6. If before retiring a member dies after completing three years of eligible employment, except for
supreme and district court judges, who must have completed five years of eligible
employment, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the member's designated
beneficiary as provided in this subsection. If the member has designated an alternate
beneficiary with the surviving spouse's written consent, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the named beneficiary. If the member has named more than one primary
beneficiary, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the named primary
beneficiaries in the percentages designated by the member or, if the member has not
designated a percentage for the beneficiaries, in equal percentages. If one or more of the
primary beneficiaries has predeceased the member, the board shall pay the predeceased
beneficiary's share to the remaining primary beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the
member, yet dies before distribution of the beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated
as if the beneficiary predeceased the member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries,
the board shall pay the member's account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in the same
manner. If there are no remaining designated beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the member's estate. If the member has not designated an alternate
beneficiary or the surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the surviving spouse of the member may
select a form of payment as follows:
a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may select one
of the following optional forms of payment:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of normal
retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.
b. The surviving spouse of all other members may select one of the following options:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the deceased
member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse dies.
(3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the payment of
a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have been paid to the

H. B. NO. 1274 - PAGE 10
surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of the member's death and
had selected a one hundred percent joint and survivor annuity, payable until the
spouse dies. A surviving spouse who received a benefit under this subsection as of
July 31, 1995, is entitled to the higher of that person's existing benefit or the
equivalent of the accrued benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and
survivor provision as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with
the increase payable beginning August 1, 1995.
7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment because
of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary reason prior to
retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is entitled to the member's
account balance at termination. The board automatically shall refund a member's account
balance if the member has completed less than three years of eligible employment, has an
account balance of less than one thousand dollars, and was not a supreme or district court
judge. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the board automatically shall
refund a member's account balance if the member completed less than five years of eligible
employment. A member may waive the refund if the member submits a written statement to
the board, within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's account balance
remain in the fund.
8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the member's
primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse designates an
alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement benefits or the member's
surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before the total amount of benefits paid to
either or both equals the amount of the member's account balance at retirement, the
difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit payment owed to the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary which was not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no
named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.
9. The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the following
optional forms:
a. Single life.
b. An actuarially equivalent joint and survivor option, with fifty percent or one hundred
percent options.
c. Actuarially equivalent life with ten-year or twenty-year certain options.
d. An actuarially equivalent partial lump sum distribution option with a twelve-month
maximum lump sum distribution.
e. An actuarially equivalent graduated benefit option with either a one percent or two
percent increase to be applied the first day of January of each year.
Except for supreme and district court judges, unless a member specifically requests that the
member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time of applying for
retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life benefit. For supreme and
district court judges, unless a member specifically requests that the member receive benefits
according to one of these options at the time of applying for retirement, all retirement benefits
must be in the form of a lifetime monthly pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for
the life of the surviving spouse, if any.
10. The fund may accept rollovers from other eligible plans under rules adopted by the board for
the purchase of additional service credit, but only to the extent the transfer is a rollover
contribution that meets the requirement of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.

H. B. NO. 1274 - PAGE 11
11. The board may accept trustee-to-trustee transfers as permitted by Internal Revenue Code
section 403(b)(13) and section 457(e)(17) from an Internal Revenue Code section 403(b)
annuity or Internal Revenue Code section 457 deferred compensation plan for the purchase of
permissive service credit, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 415(n)(3)(A) or as
repayment of a cashout from a governmental plan under Internal Revenue Code section
415(k)(3).
12. The board may establish individual retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities as
permitted under section 408(q) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow employees to make
voluntary employee contributions. The board may adopt rules to implement and administer the
accounts and annuities under this section.

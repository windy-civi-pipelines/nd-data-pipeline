25 is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted
26 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
27 3. The rules of the commission have the force of law in each participating state, provided

10 comments timely received.

28 c. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
29 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission's

12 terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
13 delegates of the participating states, and all rights, privileges and benefits
14 conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective
15 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
16 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
17 c. Termination of participation in this compact must be imposed only after all other
18 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. The commission shall

Page No. 23 25.0594.01000
Sixty-ninth

2 compact.
3 b. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter

6 model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
7 c. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the

10 commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.

14 the day this compact becomes law in that state.
15 3. Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing
16 the same.
17 a. A participating state's withdrawal does not take effect until one hundred eighty
18 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During this one hundred eighty
19 day-period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and
20 were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state remain in effect. If
21 any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in another
22 participating state or obtains a license in another participating state within the one
23 hundred eighty days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating
24 states are not affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty days.

5 and between a participating state and nonparticipating state which does not conflict
6 with the provisions of this compact.
7 5. This compact may be amended by the participating states. An amendment to this
8 compact may not become effective and binding on any participating state until it is
9 enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as
10 determined by the commission.
11 43-17.5-12. Construction and severability.
12 1. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
13 so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the
14 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
15 promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking
16 authority solely for those purposes.
17 2. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or
18 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
19 the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact,
20 or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person
21 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
22 validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other
23 government, agency, person or circumstance are not affected thereby.

25 compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 43 - 17.5 - 10, terminate a
26 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional
27 requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to
28 participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
29 compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the
30 compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states

1 and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable
2 matters.
3 43-17.5-13. Binding effect of compact.
4 1. This compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a participating
5 state that is not inconsistent with this compact.

10 commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.

15 3. Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing
16 the same.

28 withdrawal.

5 and between a participating state and nonparticipating state which does not conflict
6 with the provisions of this compact.
7 5. This compact may be amended by the participating states. An amendment to this
8 compact may not become effective and binding on any participating state until it is
9 enacted materially in the same manner into the laws of all participating states as
10 determined by the commission.
11 43-17.5-12. Construction and severability.
12 1. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
13 so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the
14 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
15 promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking
16 authority solely for those purposes.
17 2. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or
18 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
19 the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact,
20 or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person
21 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
22 validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other
23 government, agency, person or circumstance are not affected thereby.

25 compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 43 - 17.5 - 10, terminate a
26 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional
27 requirement of a participating state is, or would be with respect to a state seeking to
28 participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this
29 compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the
30 compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states

1 and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable
2 matters.
3 43-17.5-13. Binding effect of compact.

5 state that is not inconsistent with this compact.

exercised, and shall provide for the method by which the power or powers shall be exercised.
When the agreement provides for the use of a joint water resource board, the joint board shall
be representative of the boards which are parties to the agreement. Notwithstanding other
provisions of law, the agreement may specify the number, composition, terms, or qualifications
of the members of the joint board. However, the joint board must consist of an equal number
of members from each district comprising the joint board. A joint board created under this
section is a political subdivision of the state.

individual budgets to carry out the purpose of the agreement. In addition, a joint board
established pursuant to this section may adopt, by resolution, on or before July first of each
year, a budget showing estimated expenses for the ensuing fiscal year and the proposed
contributions of each member district as determined by the agreement. The boards of the
member districts then shall levy by resolution a tax not to exceed two mills upon the taxable
valuation of the real property within each district within the river basin or region subject to the
joint agreement. The levy may be in excess of any other levy authorized for a district.
3. The proceeds of one-half of this levy shall be credited to the joint board's administrative fund
and shall be used for regulatory activities and for the construction and maintenance of projects
of common benefit to the member districts. The remainder shall be credited to the construction
funds of the joint board and shall be used for the construction and maintenance of projects of
common benefit to more than one district.
4. Funds may be paid to and disbursed by the joint board as agreed upon, but the method of
disbursement shall agree as far as practicable with the method provided by law for the
disbursement of funds by individual districts. Contracts let and purchases made under the
agreements shall conform to the requirements applicable to contracts and purchases by
individual districts. The joint board shall be accountable for all funds and reports of all receipts
and disbursements to the state water commission in a manner prescribed by the commission.
5. The agreement may be continued for a definite term or until rescinded or terminated in
accordance with its terms. The agreement shall provide for the disposition of any property
required as the result of a joint or cooperative exercise of powers, and the return of any
surplus moneys in proportion to contributions of the several contracting districts after the
purpose of the agreement has been completed.

district of the requirement to form a joint board. If the district refuses to form a joint board, the
district shall proceed with the reassessment and include the property in the project
assessment district. Affected landowners subject to assessments may appeal the

appeal periods under this chapter, the district shall direct the county auditor of each county

the district court shall award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the joint board or district
seeking the writ of mandamus.
6. If the members of the joint board cannot agree about the necessity of a project, the process to
undertake an approved project, or the procedure to assess benefits, the joint board shall
request assistance from the North Dakota mediation service to resolve grievances arising from
the conflict. After receiving the request, the North Dakota mediation service shall assist the
members of the joint board to mediate the conflict. The North Dakota mediation service shall
issue a proposed mediation agreement within thirty days of completing the mediation. Each
member of the joint board shall participate in good faith in the mediation.
7. If the proposed mediation agreement is not agreed to by a majority of the members of a joint
board, a member of the joint board may file an appeal with the department of water resources
to issue a determination to resolve the conflict. The appealing party must file the appeal within
thirty days of the issuance of the proposed mediation agreement under subsection 6. Within
sixty days of receipt of the appeal, the department of water resources shall review and
investigate the complaint and issue its determination. A hearing held by the department of
water resources under this section is a prerequisite to issuing a determination under this
subsection.

of the members of a joint board, a member of the joint board may appeal the decision of the
department of water resources to the appropriate district court under chapter 28 - 32. A hearing
held by the department of water resources under this section is a prerequisite to filing an
appeal with the district court.

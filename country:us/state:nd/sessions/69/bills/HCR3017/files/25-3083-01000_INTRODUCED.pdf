Introduced by
Representatives Novak, D. Anderson, Dockter, J. Olson, S. Olson, Porter, Tveit
Senators Kessel, Patten, Boehm
1 A concurrent resolution recognizing December 6th as annual "Miner's Day" to honor the hard
2 work and dedication of coal miners, whose critical efforts provide reliable and affordable energy
3 to millions of people, fuel economic growth, and support the energy security of North Dakota
4 and the region.
5 WHEREAS, North Dakota's lignite coal industry is a cornerstone of the state's economy,
6 contributing over $5.5 billion in total business activity, employing 12,000 individuals with some of
7 the highest wages in the state, and generating $100 million in tax revenue to support schools,
8 infrastructure, and public services; and
9 WHEREAS, lignite coal generates 55 percent of North Dakota's electricity, providing
10 affordable and reliable power to more than 2 million families and businesses throughout the
11 upper Midwest while supporting regional energy security; and
12 WHEREAS, North Dakota consistently ranks among the states with the lowest residential
13 electricity rates in the nation, with an average rate of 11.44 cents per kilowatt-hour as of 2025,
14 ranking second-lowest in the United States, largely due to coal serving as the dominant source
15 of electricity generation in the state, which ensures reliability and affordability for residents; and
16 WHEREAS, North Dakota has an estimated 800-year supply of economically recoverable
17 lignite coal reserves, ensuring long-term energy independence and resource stability for the
18 state and the nation; and
19 WHEREAS, advancements in carbon capture technologies have unlocked opportunities to
20 transform carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based energy production into valuable
21 commodities, including fertilizers, industrial chemicals, enhanced oil recovery products, and
22 low-carbon fuels, which benefit North Dakota's agricultural and industrial sectors; and
23 WHEREAS, carbon dioxide is critical for plant life and global food production through
24 photosynthesis, and North Dakota's lignite coal industry is well-positioned to support agricultural
25 innovation by converting captured carbon into sustainable agricultural products; and

Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, value-added uses of lignite coal, such as activated carbon, synthetic graphite,
2 critical mineral and rare earth element extraction, and advanced materials, demonstrate the
3 versatility and economic potential of coal as a resource that extends beyond power generation;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, the development and deployment of lignite coal technologies create economic
6 diversification, expand market opportunities, and ensure the long-term sustainability of coal as a
7 critical resource for North Dakota; and
8 WHEREAS, federal regulations have created a de facto ban on the construction of new
9 coal-based power plants by imposing economically unfeasible requirements, jeopardizing the
10 continued operation of existing plants and discouraging private investment; and
11 WHEREAS, federal policies and tax incentives have provided subsidies to renewable
12 energy resources for over 30 years, creating market imbalances that place coal at a competitive
13 disadvantage and hinder its ability to contribute to a balanced, reliable, and affordable energy
14 mix; and
15 WHEREAS, North Dakota serves as a model for responsible resource development,
16 consistently reclaiming mined land to a condition equal to or better than its original state and
17 meeting all federal ambient air quality standards, one of only four states to have never violated
18 those standards; and
19 WHEREAS, affordable, reliable energy is the backbone of established industries in North
20 Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy
21 production is vital for supporting the growth of emerging technologies and innovations across
22 the Upper Midwest; and
23 WHEREAS, advancements in energy technologies to offer enormous potential to ensure
24 the continued use of lignite coal while reducing emissions and contributing to environmental
25 sustainability; and
26 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump declared a national energy emergency in January
27 2025, emphasizing the importance of using domestic energy resources, including lignite coal, to
28 strengthen the reliability and affordability of energy for the United States; and
29 WHEREAS, the administration's "unleashing American energy" executive order calls for the
30 expansion of energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters, reducing barriers
31 to development and promoting the use of reliable resources such as coal; and

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to
2 review and reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which classified greenhouse gases as
3 harmful to public health, potentially paving the way for balanced, economically viable
4 regulations that protect both the environment and energy production; and
5 WHEREAS, the repeal of the Endangerment Finding would eliminate regulatory barriers
6 that have effectively prevented the construction of new coal-based power plants, allowing for
7 the development of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible coal technologies;
8 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
9 NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
10 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly recognizes December 6th as "Miner's Day" to
11 honor the hard work and dedication of coal miners, whose critical efforts provide reliable and
12 affordable energy to millions of people, fuel economic growth, and support the energy security
13 of North Dakota and the region; and
14 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to refrain from enacting
15 regulations that jeopardize the reliability and affordability of electric power in North Dakota,
16 while supporting policies that improve market conditions for base-load electricity, encourage the
17 expansion of generation resources, and accelerate research, development, and deployment of
18 technologies essential to the lignite plant of the future; and
19 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to review and repeal
20 the 2009 Endangerment Finding to enable a balanced regulatory framework that supports coal-
21 based energy production and economic growth while addressing environmental concerns; and
22 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to revise policies and
23 regulations that unfairly disadvantage coal-based energy production, ensuring a level playing
24 field that allows all energy resources, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables, to
25 compete fairly in the electricity marketplace; and
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government work collaboratively with the
27 state of North Dakota, the North Dakota Congressional Delegation, and the lignite coal industry
28 to develop regulatory frameworks based on sound science, the status of existing technologies,
29 and economically feasible timelines; and
30 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that federal agencies increase their partnership with North
31 Dakota to accelerate technological advancements in critical and rare earth minerals, carbon

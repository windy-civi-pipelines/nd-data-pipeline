ENGROSSED HOUSE
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3017
Introduced by
Representatives Novak, D. Anderson, Dockter, J. Olson, S. Olson, Porter, Tveit
Senators Kessel, Patten, Boehm
1 A concurrent resolution recognizing December 6th as annual "Miner's Day" to honor the hard
2 work and dedication of coal miners, whose critical efforts provide reliable and affordable energy
3 to millions of people, fuel economic growth, and support the energy security of North Dakota
4 and the region.
5 WHEREAS, North Dakota's lignite coal industry is a cornerstone of the state's economy,
6 contributing over $5.5 billion in total business activity, employing 12,000 individuals with some of
7 the highest wages in the state, and generating $100 million in tax revenue to support schools,
8 infrastructure, and public services; and
9 WHEREAS, lignite coal generates 55 percent of North Dakota's electricity, providing
10 affordable and reliable power to more than 2 million families and businesses throughout the
11 upper Midwest while supporting regional energy security; and
12 WHEREAS, North Dakota consistently ranks among the states with the lowest residential
13 electricity rates in the nation, with an average rate of 11.44 cents per kilowatt-hour as of 2025,
14 ranking second-lowest in the United States, largely due to coal serving as the dominant source
15 of electricity generation in the state, which ensures reliability and affordability for residents; and
16 WHEREAS, North Dakota has an estimated 800-year supply of economically recoverable
17 lignite coal reserves, ensuring long-term energy independence and resource stability for the
18 state and the nation; and
19 WHEREAS, recent studies by the North Dakota Geological Survey have confirmed the
20 presence of significant concentrations of rare earth elements in the state's lignite coal deposits,
21 including samples that surpass the United States Department of Energy's economic extraction
22 threshold of 300 parts per million; and

Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, the extraction of critical minerals and rare earth elements from this state's
2 lignite coal seams and associated deposits offers the state an opportunity to diversify its
3 economy, create high-value careers, and establish itself as a leader in this emerging sector; and
4 WHEREAS, value-added uses of lignite coal, such as activated carbon, synthetic graphite,
5 critical mineral and rare earth element extraction, and advanced materials, demonstrate the
6 versatility and economic potential of coal as a resource that extends beyond power generation;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, responsible development of these resources can be achieved by ensuring
9 environmental stewardship, protecting freshwater supplies, and supporting land reclamation
10 practices that align with prior land use and productivity; and
11 WHEREAS, advancements in carbon capture technologies have unlocked opportunities to
12 transform carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based energy production into valuable
13 commodities, including fertilizers, industrial chemicals, enhanced oil recovery products, and
14 low-carbon fuels, which benefit North Dakota's agricultural and industrial sectors; and
15 WHEREAS, carbon dioxide is critical for plant life and global food production through
16 photosynthesis, and North Dakota's lignite coal industry is well-positioned to support agricultural
17 innovation by converting captured carbon into sustainable agricultural products; and
18 WHEREAS, the development and deployment of lignite coal technologies create economic
19 diversification, expand market opportunities, and ensure the long-term sustainability of coal as a
20 critical resource for North Dakota; and
21 WHEREAS, federal regulations have created a de facto ban on the construction of new
22 coal-based power plants by imposing economically unfeasible requirements, jeopardizing the
23 continued operation of existing plants and discouraging private investment; and
24 WHEREAS, federal policies and tax incentives have provided subsidies to renewable
25 energy resources for over 30 years, creating market imbalances that place coal at a competitive
26 disadvantage and hinder its ability to contribute to a balanced, reliable, and affordable energy
27 mix; and
28 WHEREAS, North Dakota serves as a model for responsible resource development,
29 consistently reclaiming mined land to a condition equal to or better than its original state and
30 meeting all federal ambient air quality standards, one of only four states to have never violated
31 those standards; and

1 WHEREAS, affordable, reliable energy is the backbone of established industries in North
2 Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy
3 productionand is vital for supporting the growth of emerging technologies and innovations
4 across the Upper Midwest; and
5 WHEREAS, advancements in energy technologies offer enormous potential to ensure the
6 continued use of lignite coal while reducing emissions and contributing to environmental
7 sustainability; and
8 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump declared a national energy emergency in January
9 2025, emphasizing the importance of using domestic energy resources, including lignite coal, to
10 strengthen the reliability and affordability of energy for the United States; and
11 WHEREAS, the administration's "unleashing American energy" executive order calls for the
12 expansion of energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters, reducing barriers
13 to development and promoting the use of reliable resources such as coal; and
14 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to
15 review and reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which classified greenhouse gases as
16 harmful to public health, potentially paving the way for balanced, economically viable
17 regulations that protect both the environment and energy production; and
18 WHEREAS, the repeal of the Endangerment Finding would eliminate regulatory barriers
19 that have effectively prevented the construction of new coal-based power plants, allowing for
20 the development of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible coal technologies;
21 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
22 NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
23 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly recognizes December 6th as "Miner's Day" to
24 honor the hard work and dedication of coal miners, whose critical efforts provide reliable and
25 affordable energy to millions of people, fuel economic growth, and support the energy security
26 of North Dakota and the region; and
27 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to refrain from enacting
28 regulations that jeopardize the reliability and affordability of electric power in North Dakota,
29 while supporting policies that improve market conditions for base-load electricity, encourage the
30 expansion of generation resources, and accelerate research, development, and deployment of
31 technologies essential to the lignite plant of the future; and

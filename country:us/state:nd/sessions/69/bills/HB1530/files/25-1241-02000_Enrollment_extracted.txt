(4) Uncompensated time for planning and implementing behavior intervention plans
separate from teacher preparation time;
(5) Lack of adequate space to meet the needs of students demonstrating violent
behavior;
(6) The unmet need for additional highly qualified paraprofessional support in situations
involving students with violent behavior; and

due to injuries that occurred at work.
c. Special education paraprofessional management duties, including:

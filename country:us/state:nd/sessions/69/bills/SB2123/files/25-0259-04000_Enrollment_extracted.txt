6 - 08.6 - 07. Property interest of depositor or beneficiary .
1. A depositor or a beneficiary does not have a property interest in the special deposit itself.
2. The only property interest with respect to a special deposit is the right to receive payment if
the bank or credit union is obligated to pay a beneficiary. Any property interest under this
subsection is determined under other law.
6 - 08.6 - 08. When creditor process is enforceable against bank or credit union .
1. Subject to subsection 2, creditor process with respect to a special deposit is not enforceable
against the bank or credit union holding the special deposit.
2. Creditor process is enforceable against the bank or credit union holding a special deposit with
respect to an amount the bank or credit union is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if
the process:
a. Is served on the bank or credit union;
b. Provides sufficient information to allow the bank or credit union to identify the depositor or
the beneficiary from the bank's or credit union's books and records; and
c. Gives the bank or credit union a reasonable opportunity to act on the process.
3. Creditor process served on a bank or credit union before it is enforceable against the bank or
credit union under subsection 2 does not create a right of the creditor against the bank or
credit union or a duty of the bank or credit union to the creditor. Other law determines whether
creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a contingent interest of a
beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the bank or
credit union.
6 - 08.6 - 09. Injunction or similar relief .
A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the effect of enjoining, a bank or credit
union from paying a depositor or beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or
facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
6 - 08.6 - 10. Recoupment or set off .
1. Except as provided in subsection 2 or 3, a bank or credit union may not exercise a right of
recoupment or set off against a special deposit.
2. An account agreement may allow the bank or credit union to debit the special deposit:
a. When the bank or credit union becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, in an amount that
does not exceed the amount necessary to discharge the obligation;
b. For a fee assessed by the bank or credit union that relates to an overdraft in the special
deposit account;
c. For costs incurred by the bank or credit union that relate directly to the special deposit; or
d. To reverse an earlier credit posted by the bank or credit union to the balance of the
special deposit account, if the reversal occurs under an event or circumstance warranted
under other law governing mistake and restitution.

S. B. NO. 2123 - PAGE 6
3. The bank or credit union holding a special deposit may exercise a right of recoupment or set
off against an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even if the bank or credit union funds payment
from the special deposit.
6 - 08.6 - 11. Duties and liability of bank or credit union .
1. A bank or credit union does not have a fiduciary duty to any person with respect to a special
deposit.
2. When the bank or credit union holding a special deposit becomes obligated to pay a
beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship arises between the bank or credit union and
beneficiary.
3. The bank or credit union holding a special deposit has a duty to a beneficiary to comply with
the account agreement and this chapter.
4. If the bank or credit union holding a special deposit does not comply with the account
agreement or this chapter, the bank or credit union is liable to a depositor or beneficiary only
for damages proximately caused by the noncompliance. Except as provided by other law, the
bank or credit union is not liable for consequential, special, or exemplary damages.
5. The bank or credit union holding a special deposit may rely on records presented in
compliance with the account agreement to determine whether the bank or credit union is
obligated to pay a beneficiary.
6. If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record, the bank or credit
union shall determine within a reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to require
payment. If the agreement requires action by the bank or credit union on presentation of a
record, the bank or credit union is not liable for relying in good faith on the genuineness of the
record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
7. Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank or credit union is not required to
determine whether a permissible purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist.
6 - 08.6 - 12. Term and termination .
1. Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a special deposit terminates five years
after the date the special deposit was first funded.
2. Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the bank or credit union cannot
identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when the special deposit is terminated, and
a balance remains in the special deposit, the bank or credit union shall pay the balance to the
depositor as a beneficiary.
3. A bank or credit union that pays the remaining balance as provided under subsection 2 has no
further obligation with respect to the special deposit.
6 - 08.6 - 13. Principles of law and equity .
Title 41, consumer protection law, law governing deposits generally, law related to escheat and
abandoned or unclaimed property, and the principles of law and equity, including law related to capacity
to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, and
bankruptcy, supplement this chapter except to the extent inconsistent with this chapter.
6 - 08.6 - 14. Uniformity of application and construction .
In applying and construing this chapter, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the law
among the states that enact it.

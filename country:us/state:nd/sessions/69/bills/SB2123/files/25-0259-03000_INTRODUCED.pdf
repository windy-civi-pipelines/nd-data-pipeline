24 itself.

27 interest under this subsection is determined under other law.

12 determines whether creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary
13 on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary, even if
14 not enforceable against the bank or credit union.
15 6 - 08.6 - 09. Injunction or similar relief .
16 A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the effect of enjoining, a bank or

18 fraud or facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
19 6 - 08.6 - 10. Recoupment or set off .
20 1. Except as provided in subsection 2 or 3, a bank or credit union may not exercise a
21 right of recoupment or set off against a special deposit.

18 compliance with the account agreement to determine whether the bank or credit union
19 is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
20 6. If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record, the bank or
21 credit union shall determine within a reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to

24 on the genuineness of the record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
25 7. Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank or credit union is not
26 required to determine whether a permissible purpose stated in the agreement

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 57-60-02 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
57-60-02. Imposition of taxes. (Effective throughafter June 30, 2026 , and through June 30 ,
2031)
There is hereby imposed upon the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid monthly for
the privilege of producing products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the tax must be
computed as follows:
1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is in the
amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale of a capital
asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of one mill
times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of hours in the
taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin construction or complete
repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this subsection for five
years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable
production after repowering from the unit. If a unit is incapable of generating electricity for
eighteen consecutive months, the tax on that unit for taxable periods beginning after the
eighteenth month must be reduced by the ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the
original cost of the unit. This reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of
generating electricity.
3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is a tax
at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of electricity
produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that begin construction or
complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt from the tax imposed by this
subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the
first taxable production after repowering from the plant.
4. For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in subsection 1
or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet [28316.85 liters] of synthetic
natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not including any amount of synthetic natural
gas in excess of one hundred ten million cubic feet per day.
5. For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the production from
the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this section for a period

H. B. NO. 1279 - PAGE 2
of five years from the date of first taxable production from the facility. The operator of each
facility applying for exemption under this subsection shall certify to the tax commissioner the
date of first taxable production of the facility.
6. For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand pounds
[907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or one and
one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the preceding month,
whichever amount is greater. Any amount of beneficiated coal produced in excess of eighty
percent of the design capacity of the coal beneficiation plant or produced for use within a coal
conversion facility is exempt from such tax.
7. With the exception of the tax imposed under subsection 3, the board of county commissioners,
by resolution, may grant the operator of a plant or facility located within the county a partial or
complete exemption from up to fifteen percent of the tax imposed under this section for a
period not to extend past June 30, 20262031. If a board of county commissioners grants a
partial or complete exemption for a specific plant or facility under this subsection, subsection 2
of section 57-60-14 does not apply. Notwithstanding section 57-60-14, any tax collected from
a plant or facility subject to the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated
entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.
Imposition of taxes. (Effective after June 30, 20262031) There is hereby imposed upon the
operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid monthly for the privilege of producing products of
such coal conversion facility. The rate of the tax must be computed as follows:
1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is in the
amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale of a capital
asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of one mill
times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of hours in the
taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin construction or complete
repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this subsection for five
years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable
production after repowering from the unit. The board of county commissioners may, by
resolution, grant to the operator of an electrical generating plant located within the county
partial or complete exemption from the remaining fifteen percent of the tax imposed by this
subsection for a period not exceeding five years from the date of the first taxable production or
from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. If a board of county
commissioners grants a partial or complete exemption for a specific coal conversion facility
under this subsection, the provisions of subsection 2 of section 57-60-14 do not apply as that
subsection relates to revenue from the specific unit of the coal conversion facility for which the
partial or complete exemption has been granted. Notwithstanding section 57-60-14, any tax
collected from a unit subject to the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated
entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section 57-60-15. If a unit is incapable of
generating electricity for eighteen consecutive months, the tax on that unit for taxable periods
beginning after the eighteenth month must be reduced by the ratio that the cost of repair of the
unit bears to the original cost of the unit. This reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is
capable of generating electricity.
3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is a tax
at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of electricity
produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that begin construction or
complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt from the tax imposed by this

conversion facility, other than an electrical generating plant, located within the county a
partial or complete exemption from the remaining fifteen percent of tax imposed by this
section for a period not exceeding five years from the date of the first taxable production
from the facility. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 57-60-14, any tax collected
which is based upon the production of a facility subject to the exemption provided by this
subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section
57-60-15.

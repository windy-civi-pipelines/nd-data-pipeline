1 A BILL for an Act to amend and reenact sections 57-60-02, 57-60-02.2, 57-60-14, and 57-61-01
2 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to an exemption from the coal conversion facilities
3 tax and the imposition of a lignite research tax, allocation of the coal conversion facilities
4 privilege tax and the lignite research tax, and an exemption from the coal severance tax; to
5 provide an effective date; and to provide an expiration date.
6 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
7 SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 57-60-02 of the North Dakota Century Code is
8 amended and reenacted as follows:
9 57-60-02. Imposition of taxes. (Effective through June 30, 20262036)
10 There is hereby imposed upon the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid
11 monthly for the privilege of producing products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the
12 tax must be computed as follows:
13 1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
14 measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is
15 in the amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale
16 of a capital asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
17 2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of
18 one mill times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of
19 hours in the taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin
20 construction or complete repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax
21 imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production
22 or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. If a unit
23 is incapable of generating electricity for eighteen consecutive months, the tax on that
24 unit for taxable periods beginning after the eighteenth month must be reduced by the
Page No. 1 25.0895.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the original cost of the unit. This
2 reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of generating electricity.
3 3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is
4 a tax at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of
5 electricity produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that
6 begin construction or complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt
7 from the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable
8 production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the
9 plant.
10 4. For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in
11 subsection 1 or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet
12 [28316.85 liters] of synthetic natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not
13 including any amount of synthetic natural gas in excess of one hundred ten million
14 cubic feet per day.
15 5. For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the production
16 from the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this section
17 for a period of five years from the date of first taxable production from the facility. The
18 operator of each facility applying for exemption under this subsection shall certify to
19 the tax commissioner the date of first taxable production of the facility.
20 6. For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand
21 pounds [907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or
22 one and one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the
23 preceding month, whichever amount is greater. Any amount of beneficiated coal
24 produced in excess of eighty percent of the design capacity of the coal beneficiation
25 plant or produced for use within a coal conversion facility is exempt from such tax.
26 7. With the exception of the tax imposed under subsection 3, the board of county
27 commissioners, by resolution, may grant the operator of a plant or facility located
28 within the county a partial or complete exemption from up to fifteen percent of the tax
29 imposed under this section for a period not to extend past June 30, 20262036. If a
30 board of county commissioners grants a partial or complete exemption for a specific
31 plant or facility under this subsection, subsection 2 of section 57-60-14 does not apply.

Legislative Assembly
1 Notwithstanding section 57-60-14, any tax collected from a plant or facility subject to
2 the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for
3 allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.
4 Imposition of taxes. (Effective after June 30, 20262036) There is hereby imposed upon
5 the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid monthly for the privilege of producing
6 products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the tax must be computed as follows:
7 1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
8 measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is
9 in the amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale
10 of a capital asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
11 2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of one
12 mill times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of hours
13 in the taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin construction or
14 complete repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this
15 subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date
16 of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. The board of county
17 commissioners may, by resolution, grant to the operator of an electrical generating
18 plant located within the county partial or complete exemption from the remaining
19 fifteen percent of the tax imposed by this subsection for a period not exceeding five
20 years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable
21 production after repowering from the unit. If a board of county commissioners grants a
22 partial or complete exemption for a specific coal conversion facility under this
23 subsection, the provisions of subsection 2 of section 57-60-14 do not apply as that
24 subsection relates to revenue from the specific unit of the coal conversion facility for
25 which the partial or complete exemption has been granted. Notwithstanding section
26 57-60-14, any tax collected from a unit subject to the exemption provided by this
27 subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section
28 57-60-15. If a unit is incapable of generating electricity for eighteen consecutive
29 months, the tax on that unit for taxable periods beginning after the eighteenth month
30 must be reduced by the ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the original cost

1 of the unit. This reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of generating
2 electricity.
3 3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is
4 a tax at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of
5 electricity produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that
6 begin construction or complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt
7 from the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable
8 production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the
9 plant.
10 4. For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in
11 subsection 1 or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet
12 [28316.85 liters] of synthetic natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not
13 including any amount of synthetic natural gas in excess of one hundred ten million
14 cubic feet per day.
15 5. a. For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the
16 production from the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax
17 imposed by this section for a period of five years from the date of first taxable
18 production from the facility. The operator of each facility applying for exemption
19 under this subsection shall certify to the tax commissioner the date of first taxable
20 production of the facility.
21 b. The board of county commissioners may, by resolution, grant to the operator of a
22 coal conversion facility, other than an electrical generating plant, located within
23 the county a partial or complete exemption from the remaining fifteen percent of
24 tax imposed by this section for a period not exceeding five years from the date of
25 the first taxable production from the facility. Notwithstanding the provisions of
26 section 57-60-14, any tax collected which is based upon the production of a
27 facility subject to the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated
28 entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.
29 6. For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand
30 pounds [907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or
31 one and one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the
Page No. 4 25.0895.01000

Senators Boehm, Patten, Thomas
1 A BILL for an Act to amend and reenact sections 57-60-02, 57-60-02.2, 57-60-14, and 57-61-01
2 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to an exemption from the coal conversion facilities
3 tax and the imposition of a lignite research tax, allocation of the coal conversion facilities
4 privilege tax and the lignite research tax, and an exemption from the coal severance tax; to
5 provide an effective date; and to provide an expiration date.
6 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
7 SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 57-60-02 of the North Dakota Century Code is
8 amended and reenacted as follows:
9 57-60-02. Imposition of taxes. (Effective through June 30, 20262036)
10 There is hereby imposed upon the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid
11 monthly for the privilege of producing products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the
12 tax must be computed as follows:
13 1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
14 measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is
15 in the amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale
16 of a capital asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
17 2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of
18 one mill times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of
19 hours in the taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin
20 construction or complete repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax
21 imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production
22 or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. If a unit
23 is incapable of generating electricity for eighteen consecutive months, the tax on that
24 unit for taxable periods beginning after the eighteenth month must be reduced by the
Page No. 1 25.0895.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the original cost of the unit. This
2 reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of generating electricity.
3 3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is
4 a tax at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of
5 electricity produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that
6 begin construction or complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt
7 from the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable
8 production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the
9 plant.
10 4. For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in
11 subsection 1 or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet
12 [28316.85 liters] of synthetic natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not
13 including any amount of synthetic natural gas in excess of one hundred ten million
14 cubic feet per day.
15 5. For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the production
16 from the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this section
17 for a period of five years from the date of first taxable production from the facility. The
18 operator of each facility applying for exemption under this subsection shall certify to
19 the tax commissioner the date of first taxable production of the facility.
20 6. For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand
21 pounds [907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or
22 one and one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the
23 preceding month, whichever amount is greater. Any amount of beneficiated coal
24 produced in excess of eighty percent of the design capacity of the coal beneficiation
25 plant or produced for use within a coal conversion facility is exempt from such tax.
26 7. With the exception of the tax imposed under subsection 3, the board of county
27 commissioners, by resolution, may grant the operator of a plant or facility located
28 within the county a partial or complete exemption from up to fifteen percent of the tax
29 imposed under this section for a period not to extend past June 30, 20262036. If a
30 board of county commissioners grants a partial or complete exemption for a specific
31 plant or facility under this subsection, subsection 2 of section 57-60-14 does not apply.

1 Notwithstanding section 57-60-14, any tax collected from a plant or facility subject to
2 the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for
3 allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.
4 Imposition of taxes. (Effective after June 30, 20262036) There is hereby imposed upon
5 the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid monthly for the privilege of producing
6 products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the tax must be computed as follows:
7 1. For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is
8 measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is
9 in the amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale
10 of a capital asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
11 2. For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of one
12 mill times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of hours
13 in the taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin construction or
14 complete repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this
15 subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date
16 of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. The board of county
17 commissioners may, by resolution, grant to the operator of an electrical generating
18 plant located within the county partial or complete exemption from the remaining
19 fifteen percent of the tax imposed by this subsection for a period not exceeding five
20 years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable
21 production after repowering from the unit. If a board of county commissioners grants a
22 partial or complete exemption for a specific coal conversion facility under this
23 subsection, the provisions of subsection 2 of section 57-60-14 do not apply as that
24 subsection relates to revenue from the specific unit of the coal conversion facility for
25 which the partial or complete exemption has been granted. Notwithstanding section
26 57-60-14, any tax collected from a unit subject to the exemption provided by this
27 subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section
28 57-60-15. If a unit is incapable of generating electricity for eighteen consecutive
29 months, the tax on that unit for taxable periods beginning after the eighteenth month
30 must be reduced by the ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the original cost

1 of the unit. This reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of generating
2 electricity.
3 3. For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is
4 a tax at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of
5 electricity produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that
6 begin construction or complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt
7 from the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable
8 production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the
9 plant.
10 4. For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in
11 subsection 1 or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet
12 [28316.85 liters] of synthetic natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not
13 including any amount of synthetic natural gas in excess of one hundred ten million
14 cubic feet per day.
15 5. a. For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the
16 production from the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax
17 imposed by this section for a period of five years from the date of first taxable
18 production from the facility. The operator of each facility applying for exemption
19 under this subsection shall certify to the tax commissioner the date of first taxable
20 production of the facility.
21 b. The board of county commissioners may, by resolution, grant to the operator of a
22 coal conversion facility, other than an electrical generating plant, located within
23 the county a partial or complete exemption from the remaining fifteen percent of
24 tax imposed by this section for a period not exceeding five years from the date of
25 the first taxable production from the facility. Notwithstanding the provisions of
26 section 57-60-14, any tax collected which is based upon the production of a
27 facility subject to the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated
28 entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.
29 6. For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand
30 pounds [907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or
31 one and one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the

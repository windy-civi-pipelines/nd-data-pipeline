26 probation, unless the court directs otherwise, may be filed without filing fee,
27 transcribed, and enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by

6 amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs

21 defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation.

23 pay attorney's fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in
24 any order or amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment
25 proceeding, shall notify the defendant, the defendant's probation officer, and the
26 prosecuting attorney of the presumed amount of costs and expenses to be
27 reimbursed, as determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents, and
28 of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. The reimbursement
29 amount must include an application fee imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the

11 is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on
12 the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may waive
13 reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of
14 payment.
15 d. If at any time the court finds that the defendant is able to reimburse costs and
16 expenses and has willfully failed to do so, the court may continue, modify, or
17 enlarge the conditions of probation or revoke probation as provided in
18 subsection 6 or 7, as applicable, of section 12.1-32-07.

22 part of a fine, a supervision fee, reimbursement for indigent defense costs and

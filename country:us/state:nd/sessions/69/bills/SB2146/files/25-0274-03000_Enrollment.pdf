assistant's license must include a statement that the occupational therapist's or occupational
therapy assistant's compact privilege is deactivated in all member states during the pendency
of the order.

8. The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before the commission adopts
a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:
a. At least twenty-five individuals;
b. A state or federal governmental subdivision or agency; or
c. An association or organization having at least twenty-five members.
9. If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall publish the
place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing. If the hearing is held through electronic
means, the commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
a. Any individual wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of the
commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at
the hearing not less than five business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.
b. Hearings must be conducted in a manner providing an individual who wishes to comment
a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.

S. B. NO. 2146 - PAGE 14
12. The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
and determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full
text of the rule.
13. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided the usual
rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section must be retroactively
applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the
effective date of the rule. For purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must
be adopted immediately in order to:
a. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;

c. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by
federal law or rule; or
d. Protect public health and safety.
14. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a
previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors
in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be
posted on the website of the commission. The revision is subject to challenge by any
individual for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in
writing and delivered to the chair of the commission before the end of the notice period. If a
challenge is not made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is
challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
43 - 40.1 - 11. Oversight, dispute resolution, and enforcement .
1. Oversight.
a. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member
state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the
rules adopted hereunder have standing as statutory law.
b. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or
administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this
compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission.
c. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and has
standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of
process to the commission renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this
compact, or adopted rules.
2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.
a. If the commission determines a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the adopted rules, the commission
shall:
(1) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature
of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be
taken by the commission; and
(2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

S. B. NO. 2146 - PAGE 15
b. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from
the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective
date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
c. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must
be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
d. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
extend beyond the effective date of termination.
e. The commission may not incur any costs related to a state that is found to be in default
or has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed on in writing between the
commission and the defaulting state.
f. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United
States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of
litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
3. Dispute resolution.
a. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and
nonmember states.
b. The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
resolution for disputes as appropriate.
4. Enforcement.
a. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions
and rules of this compact.
b. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district
court for the District of Columbia, or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices, against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the
provisions of the compact and its rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member
must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
c. The remedies herein are not the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
43 - 40.1 - 12. Date of implementation of the interstate compact for occupational therapy
practice and associated rules, withdrawal, and amendment.
1. The compact becomes effective on the date the compact statute is enacted into law in the
tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, are limited to the
powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the adoption of rules. Thereafter,
the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation
and administration of the compact.
2. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules is
subject to the rules as they exist on the date the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule

S. B. NO. 2146 - PAGE 16
that has been previously adopted by the commission has the full force and effect of law on the
day the compact becomes law in that state.
3. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
compact.
a. A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until six months after enactment of the
repealing statute.
b. Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's
occupational therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action
reporting requirements of this compact before the effective date of withdrawal.
4. The compact may not be construed to invalidate or prevent any occupational therapy licensure
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember
state which does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
5. This compact may be amended by the member states. An amendment to this compact may
not become effective and binding on any member state until the amendment is enacted into
the laws of all member states.
43 - 40.1 - 13. Construction and severability .
This compact must be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of the compact. The provisions
of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States or the
applicability thereof to any government, agency, individual, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of
the remainder of this compact and the applicability of this compact to any government, agency,
individual, or circumstance are not affected thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of
any member state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
43 - 40.1 - 14. Binding effect of compact and other laws .
1. A licensee providing occupational therapy in a remote state under the compact privilege shall
function within the laws and regulations of the remote state.
2. This compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a member state which is
not inconsistent with the compact.
3. A law in a member state in conflict with the compact is superseded to the extent of the conflict.
4. Any lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws adopted by the
commission, are binding on the member states.
5. All agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance
with the terms of the agreement.
6. If a provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of
any member state, the provision is ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the
constitutional provision in question in that member state.

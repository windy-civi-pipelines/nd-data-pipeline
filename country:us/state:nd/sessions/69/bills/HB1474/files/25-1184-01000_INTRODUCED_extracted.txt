11 established before January 1, 2026, the tax increment or tax losses must be
12 calculated as the difference between the square footage tax and ad valorem tax levied
13 in dollars against the lots and parcels of real estate in the district in the current taxable
14 year and the amount of ad valorem property tax levied in dollars against the origina l
15 taxable value of the lots and parcels of real estate in the district in taxable year 2025.

29 of a zero tax levy and the county auditor shall so certify.

31 which the original taxable value of square footage tax and ad valorem tax levied

3 renewal agency valuedtaxed at zero, has increased or decreased in comparison
4 with the original taxable value of all suchsquare footage tax and ad valorem tax
5 levied in dollars against the real estate. The net amount of the increase or
6 decrease is referred to in this section as the incremental valuetax increment or
7 the lost valuetax losses for that year, as the case may berespectively.
8 4. In any year when there is an incremental value, the auditor shall exclude it from the
9 taxable value upon which the auditor computes the mill rates of taxes levied in that
10 year by the state, the county, the municipality, the school district, and every other
11 political subdivision having power to tax the development or renewal area, until the
12 cost of development or renewal of the area has been reimbursed in accordance with
13 this section. However, the auditor shall extend the aggregate mill rate of those taxes
14 against the incremental value as well as the original taxable value, and the amount of
15 taxes received from that extension against the incremental value is referred to in this
16 section as the tax increment for that year.
17 5. In any year when there is a lost value, the auditor shall compute and certify the
18 amounts of taxes which would have resulted from the extension against the lost value
19 of the mill rate of taxes levied that year by the state and each political subdivision
20 having power to tax the development or renewal area. The amounts so computed are
21 referred to in this section as the tax losses for that year.
22 6. The county auditor shall segregate all tax increments from the development or renewal
23 area in a special fund, crediting to the fund an amount equal to the tax increment, in
24 each year when there is an incremental value, that proportion of each collection of
25 taxes on real estate within the area which the incremental value bears to the total
26 taxable value in that yeara tax increment.
27 7.5. Upon receipt of any tax increments in the fund, the county treasurer, at the times when
28 the county treasurer distributes collected taxes to the state and to each political
29 subdivision for which a tax loss has previously been recorded, shall also remit to each
30 of them from the tax increment fund an amount proportionate to the amount of that tax
31 loss, until all those tax losses have been reimbursed. Thereafter, at the time of each

1 distribution, the county treasurer shall remit the entire balance then on hand in the
2 fund to the municipality, until the cost of development or renewal of the area has been
3 reimbursed to the municipality as provided in this section.
4 8.6. The cost of development or renewal subject to reimbursement from the tax increment
5 fund for each development or renewal area must include all expenditures incident to
6 carrying out the development or renewal plan for the area and any modifications
7 thereof, not otherwise reimbursed in one of the ways referred to below, including all
8 expenses of the clearance, development, redevelopment, rehabilitation, and
9 conservation of the area, and all interest and redemption premiums paid on bonds,
10 notes, or other obligations issued by the municipality or urban renewal agency to
11 provide funds for payment of those expenses, subject to section 40-58-20.1 for the
12 purpose of determining eligible cost of development of industrial or commercial
13 property. From the total cost to be reimbursed there must be deducted, except as
14 provided below, all amounts received from the federal government or others, and all
15 special assessments, revenues, and other receipts except property taxes, which are
16 actually collected and applied to the payment of the cost or the bonds, notes, or other
17 obligations, at the times when those payments are due. However, if the proceeds of
18 tax increments or of bonds, notes, or other obligations are loaned to finance part or all
19 of the cost of a project comprising the restoration, reconstruction, and improvement of
20 a privately owned state historical site situated within the development or renewal area
21 or any buildings or structures thereon, as contemplated in section 55-10-08, or of a
22 property listed in the national register of historic places, as contemplated in section
23 55-10-11, in consideration of the grant to the city of a historic easement with respect
24 thereto, repayments of the loan may not be deducted from the cost of development or
25 renewal subject to reimbursement.
26 9.7. The tax increments from any development or renewal area may be appropriated by
27 the governing body of the municipality for the payment of any general obligation
28 bonds, special improvement warrants, or refunding improvement bonds issued by the
29 municipality to provide funds for payment of the cost of development or renewal,
30 together with interest and redemption premiums thereon, other than that portion, if
31 any, of such principal, interest, and redemption premiums which can be paid when due
Page No. 14 25.1184.01000

1 from collections of special assessments, revenues, or other funds, excluding property
2 taxes, which are pledged for the payment thereof. When special improvement
3 warrants or refunding improvement bonds are issued to pay the cost of public
4 improvements of special benefit to properties within the development or renewal area,
5 the governing body may cause those special benefits to be computed, together with
6 the cost properly assessable against those properties, and may appropriate the tax
7 increments from the area to the payment of that cost, in lieu of levying special
8 assessments upon the property. In this event, the amount so appropriated, divided into
9 the same number of installments as the special assessments and with interest at the
10 same rate on the declining balance thereof, is deemed a part of the special
11 assessments appropriated for payment of the cost, within the meaning of section
12 40-26-08.
13 10.8. When the cost of development or renewal of any development or renewal area has
14 been fully paid and all bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the municipality to
15 pay that cost have been retired, or funds sufficient for the retirement thereof have
16 been received by the municipality, the governing body shall cause this to be reported
17 to the county auditor, who shall thereafter compute the mill rates oflevy all taxes upon
18 the total taxable value , for property subject to ad valorem tax, or the total square
19 footage, for property subject to the tax under section 18 of this Act , of the development
20 or renewal area. Any balance then on hand in the tax increment fund must be
21 distributed by the county treasurer to the state and all political subdivisions having
22 power to tax property, including by ad valorem and square footage tax, in the area, in
23 amounts proportionate to the amounts of the tax losses previously reimbursed to
24 them.
25 11.9. As an alternative to the sale of bonds to be amortized with tax increments as provided
26 in this section, the governing body of a municipality may, in its discretion, grant a total
27 or partial tax exemption for the project in order to provide assistance to a project
28 developer in a development or renewal area, pursuant to agreement with the
29 municipality. However, if a developer of a development or renewal project receives a
30 tax exemption for that project pursuant to this subsection, that project developer may
31 not receive a tax exemption for that project under section 40-57.1-03, 40-57.1-04,

2 subsection is limited to the tax increment as defined in this section as it applies to the
3 development or renewal project and may extend for a period not to exceed fifteen
4 years. In determining the total amount of the tax exemption to be authorized, the
5 municipality shall give due consideration to the same elements as are involved in the
6 sale of bonds to be amortized by tax increments. The amount to be reimbursed, by tax
7 exemption, to the project developer must be all or a portion of eligible public costs
8 which have been paid by the project developer, plus interest on those costs at a rate
9 not to exceed ten percent per annum. The amount of tax exemption must be an
10 amount sufficient to reimburse the project operator for those eligible costs, amortized
11 pursuant to the agreement between the project developer and the municipality. If an
12 exemption has been granted under this subdivision before taxable year 2026 for
13 property that is subject to the square footage tax under section 18 of this Act in taxable
14 year 2026 or later, the governing body of a municipality shall convert the exemption as
15 necessary to allow the same tax benefit to be realized by the property owner under the
16 square footage taxation system under section 18 of this Act as would have been
17 realized under the ad valorem taxation system before taxable year 2026 .
18 12.10. The governing body of a municipality with an active tax increment financing district
19 may at any time identify funds on hand that are in excess of the costs it determines
20 necessary to complete the activities included in the last approved urban renewal plan
21 for that district. The governing body shall cause the identified surplus to be transferred
22 to the county treasurer to be distributed to the state and all political subdivisions
23 having power to tax property in the area, in amounts proportionate to the most recent
24 five-year average of the ad valorem property tax or square footage tax levy within the
25 district.

12 40-58-20. Tax increment financing.
13 1. At any time after the governing body of a municipality has approved a development or
14 renewal plan for any development or renewal area and has filed that plan with the
15 department of commerce division of community services, it may request the county
16 auditor and treasurer to compute, certify, and remit tax increments resulting from the
17 development or renewal of the area in accordance with the plan and any modifications
18 thereof, and the county auditor and treasurer shall do so in accordance with this
19 section.
20 a. For a tax increment district established before July 1, 2011, the base year for tax

1 b. For a tax increment district established after July 1, 2011, the base year for tax
2 increments computed for a development or renewal area under this section or

4 without the governing body of the municipality establishing a new base year
5 using taxable values, established as of February first of the following year, or
6 square footage taxes levied in the following taxable year, which are not more
7 than fifteen years old. The new base year may be used to compute tax
8 increments for up to an additional five years after which time the tax increment
9 district must be closed.
10 2. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, for a tax increment district
11 established before January 1, 2026, the tax increment or tax losses must be
12 calculated as the difference between the square footage tax and ad valorem tax levied
13 in dollars against the lots and parcels of real estate in the district in the current taxable
14 year and the amount of ad valorem property tax levied in dollars against the origina l
15 taxable value of the lots and parcels of real estate in the district in taxable year 2025.
16 For purposes of this subsection, "original taxable value" means the taxable value of
17 the lots and parcels of real estate in the year the tax increment district was
18 established.

20 a. The auditor shall compute and certify the original taxable value ofsquare footage
21 tax or ad valorem tax levied in dollars against each lot and parcel of real estate in

23 including the taxable value oftax levied against any lot or parcel previously
24 acquired by the municipality or its urban renewal agency, as last assessed and
25 equalizedtaxed before it was acquired. However, any real property acquired by
26 the city or the city's urban renewal agency prior to July 1, 1973, or more than five
27 years prior to the approval of a development or renewal plan for any development
28 or renewal area, whichever is later, is deemed to have an original taxable value
29 of a zero tax levy and the county auditor shall so certify.
30 3. b. In each subsequent year, the auditor shall compute and certify the net amount by
31 which the original taxable value of square footage tax and ad valorem tax levied
Page No. 12 25.1184.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 in dollars against all lots and parcels of real estate in the area, as then assessed
2 and equalizedlevied, including real estate then held by the municipality or urban
3 renewal agency valuedtaxed at zero, has increased or decreased in comparison
4 with the original taxable value of all suchsquare footage tax and ad valorem tax
5 levied in dollars against the real estate. The net amount of the increase or
6 decrease is referred to in this section as the incremental valuetax increment or
7 the lost valuetax losses for that year, as the case may berespectively.
8 4. In any year when there is an incremental value, the auditor shall exclude it from the
9 taxable value upon which the auditor computes the mill rates of taxes levied in that
10 year by the state, the county, the municipality, the school district, and every other
11 political subdivision having power to tax the development or renewal area, until the
12 cost of development or renewal of the area has been reimbursed in accordance with
13 this section. However, the auditor shall extend the aggregate mill rate of those taxes
14 against the incremental value as well as the original taxable value, and the amount of
15 taxes received from that extension against the incremental value is referred to in this
16 section as the tax increment for that year.
17 5. In any year when there is a lost value, the auditor shall compute and certify the
18 amounts of taxes which would have resulted from the extension against the lost value
19 of the mill rate of taxes levied that year by the state and each political subdivision
20 having power to tax the development or renewal area. The amounts so computed are
21 referred to in this section as the tax losses for that year.
22 6. The county auditor shall segregate all tax increments from the development or renewal
23 area in a special fund, crediting to the fund an amount equal to the tax increment, in
24 each year when there is an incremental value, that proportion of each collection of
25 taxes on real estate within the area which the incremental value bears to the total
26 taxable value in that yeara tax increment.
27 7.5. Upon receipt of any tax increments in the fund, the county treasurer, at the times when
28 the county treasurer distributes collected taxes to the state and to each political
29 subdivision for which a tax loss has previously been recorded, shall also remit to each
30 of them from the tax increment fund an amount proportionate to the amount of that tax
31 loss, until all those tax losses have been reimbursed. Thereafter, at the time of each

1 distribution, the county treasurer shall remit the entire balance then on hand in the
2 fund to the municipality, until the cost of development or renewal of the area has been
3 reimbursed to the municipality as provided in this section.
4 8.6. The cost of development or renewal subject to reimbursement from the tax increment
5 fund for each development or renewal area must include all expenditures incident to
6 carrying out the development or renewal plan for the area and any modifications
7 thereof, not otherwise reimbursed in one of the ways referred to below, including all
8 expenses of the clearance, development, redevelopment, rehabilitation, and
9 conservation of the area, and all interest and redemption premiums paid on bonds,
10 notes, or other obligations issued by the municipality or urban renewal agency to
11 provide funds for payment of those expenses, subject to section 40-58-20.1 for the
12 purpose of determining eligible cost of development of industrial or commercial
13 property. From the total cost to be reimbursed there must be deducted, except as
14 provided below, all amounts received from the federal government or others, and all
15 special assessments, revenues, and other receipts except property taxes, which are
16 actually collected and applied to the payment of the cost or the bonds, notes, or other
17 obligations, at the times when those payments are due. However, if the proceeds of
18 tax increments or of bonds, notes, or other obligations are loaned to finance part or all
19 of the cost of a project comprising the restoration, reconstruction, and improvement of
20 a privately owned state historical site situated within the development or renewal area
21 or any buildings or structures thereon, as contemplated in section 55-10-08, or of a
22 property listed in the national register of historic places, as contemplated in section
23 55-10-11, in consideration of the grant to the city of a historic easement with respect
24 thereto, repayments of the loan may not be deducted from the cost of development or
25 renewal subject to reimbursement.
26 9.7. The tax increments from any development or renewal area may be appropriated by
27 the governing body of the municipality for the payment of any general obligation
28 bonds, special improvement warrants, or refunding improvement bonds issued by the
29 municipality to provide funds for payment of the cost of development or renewal,

4 improvements of special benefit to properties within the development or renewal area,
5 the governing body may cause those special benefits to be computed, together with
6 the cost properly assessable against those properties, and may appropriate the tax
7 increments from the area to the payment of that cost, in lieu of levying special
8 assessments upon the property. In this event, the amount so appropriated, divided into
9 the same number of installments as the special assessments and with interest at the
10 same rate on the declining balance thereof, is deemed a part of the special
11 assessments appropriated for payment of the cost, within the meaning of section

17 to the county auditor, who shall thereafter compute the mill rates oflevy all taxes upon
18 the total taxable value , for property subject to ad valorem tax, or the total square
19 footage, for property subject to the tax under section 18 of this Act , of the development
20 or renewal area. Any balance then on hand in the tax increment fund must be

27 or partial tax exemption for the project in order to provide assistance to a project
28 developer in a development or renewal area, pursuant to agreement with the
29 municipality. However, if a developer of a development or renewal project receives a
30 tax exemption for that project pursuant to this subsection, that project developer may
31 not receive a tax exemption for that project under section 40-57.1-03, 40-57.1-04,

8 which have been paid by the project developer, plus interest on those costs at a rate
9 not to exceed ten percent per annum. The amount of tax exemption must be an
10 amount sufficient to reimburse the project operator for those eligible costs, amortized
11 pursuant to the agreement between the project developer and the municipality. If an
12 exemption has been granted under this subdivision before taxable year 2026 for
13 property that is subject to the square footage tax under section 18 of this Act in taxable
14 year 2026 or later, the governing body of a municipality shall convert the exemption as
15 necessary to allow the same tax benefit to be realized by the property owner under the

17 realized under the ad valorem taxation system before taxable year 2026 .
18 12.10. The governing body of a municipality with an active tax increment financing district
19 may at any time identify funds on hand that are in excess of the costs it determines
20 necessary to complete the activities included in the last approved urban renewal plan

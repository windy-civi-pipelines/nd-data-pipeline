(Representatives K. Anderson, Frelich, Meier, Pyle, M. Ruby, Tveit, Weisz, Maki)
(Senators Meyer, Paulson, Wobbema, Van Oosting)
A concurrent resolution urging Congress to provide veterans with medical coverage for hyperbaric
oxygenation therapy.
WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates between 1.6 million to
3.8 million concussions occur each year; and
WHEREAS, efforts must be made to reduce the risk and health care costs for the country,
veterans, and others with brain injuries; and
WHEREAS, veterans injured in the line of duty deserve the best treatment our nation can offer; and
WHEREAS, veterans suffering with traumatic brain injuries or posttraumatic stress disorder are
prescribed symptom-reducing drugs; and
WHEREAS, in essence, veterans are warehoused and discharged, dependent on costly
antidepressants and other antipsychotic medicines that promote dangerous dependencies and may
result in lethal interactions; and
WHEREAS, traumatic brain injury is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the
United States, accounting for approximately 2 million emergency room visits, between 230,000 and
500,000 hospital admissions, and 52,000 deaths annually in the United States; and
WHEREAS, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a medical treatment that enhances the body's natural
healing process by inhalation of one hundred percent oxygen in a total body chamber, where
atmospheric pressure is increased and controlled, and which is used for a wide variety of treatments as
a part of an overall medical care plan; and
WHEREAS, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and improving diagnostics have emerged as a promising
and effective treatment in healing injured brains and subsequently reducing, and in some cases
completely alleviating, the symptoms associated with the traumatic brain injury;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NORTH
DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges Congress to provide veterans with medical
coverage for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution to each
member of Congress.

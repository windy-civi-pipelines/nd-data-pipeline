SECTION 3. AMENDMENT. Section 47-20.2-03 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and

47-20.2-03. North Dakota coordinate system defined.
The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used in expressing the geographic
position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist of two distances,
expressed in United States survey feet [meters] and decimals of a foot [meter] when using the North
Dakota coordinate system of 1927. One of these distances, to be known as the X-coordinate, shall give
the position in an east-west direction; the other, to be known as the Y-coordinate, shall give the position
in a north-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane
rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American horizontal geodetic
control network as published by the national ocean survey/national geodetic survey, or its successors,
and the plane coordinates which have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such

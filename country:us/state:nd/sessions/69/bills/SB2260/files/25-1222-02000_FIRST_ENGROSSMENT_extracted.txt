Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 47-20.2-03. North Dakota coordinate system defined.
2 The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used in expressing the
3 geographic position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist
4 of two distances, expressed in United States survey feet [meters] and decimals of a foot [meter]
5 when using the North Dakota coordinate system of 1927. One of these distances, to be known
6 as the X-coordinate, shall give the position in an east-west direction; the other, to be known as
7 the Y-coordinate, shall give the position in a north-south direction. These coordinates shall be
8 made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented
9 points of the North American horizontal geodetic control network as published by the national
10 ocean survey/national geodetic survey, or its successors, and the plane coordinates which have
11 been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such station may be used for
12 establishing a survey connection to either North Dakota coordinate system. For the purposes of
13 converting coordinates of the North Dakota coordinate systemsystems of 1983 and 2022 from
14 meters to feet, the international survey foot must be used. The conversion factor is: one foot
15 equals 0.3048 meter exactly.

Legislative Assembly
1 47-20.2-03. North Dakota coordinate system defined.
2 The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, used in expressing the
3 geographic position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist
4 of two distances, expressed in United States survey feet [meters] and decimals of a foot [meter]
5 when using the North Dakota coordinate system of 1927. One of these distances, to be known
6 as the X-coordinate, shall give the position in an east-west direction; the other, to be known as
7 the Y-coordinate, shall give the position in a north-south direction. These coordinates shall be
8 made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented
9 points of the North American horizontal geodetic control network as published by the national
10 ocean survey/national geodetic survey, or its successors, and the plane coordinates which have
11 been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such station may be used for
12 establishing a survey connection to either North Dakota coordinate system. For the purposes of
13 converting coordinates of the North Dakota coordinate systemsystems of 1983 and 2022 from
14 meters to feet, the international survey foot must be used. The conversion factor is: one foot
15 equals 0.3048 meter exactly.

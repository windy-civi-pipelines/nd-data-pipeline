Legislative Assembly
1 2024-25 school year when sixty-eight percent of tuition received under an
2 agreement to educate students from a school district on an air force base
3 with funding received through federal impact aid must be excluded from the
4 tuition calculation under this paragraph;
5 (4) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes on the distribution and transmission
6 of electric power;
7 (5) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes on electricity generated from
8 sources other than coal; and

18 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
19 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
20 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
21 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
22 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
23 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
24 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
25 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
26 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
27 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for
28 the 2020-21 school year and for each year thereafter.
29 2. a. The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
30 subsection 1 by the district's 2017-18 weighted student units to determine the

1 b. For any school district that becomes an elementary district pursuant to section
2 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the
3 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid.
4 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
5 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
6 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
7 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
8 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
9 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
10 district and for each year thereafter.
11 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
12 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
13 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
14 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
15 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
16 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
17 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
18 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
19 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
20 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
21 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
22 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
23 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
24 greater of:
25 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred
26 forty-six dollars;
27 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
28 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
29 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
30 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the

1 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
2 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
3 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
4 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
5 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
6 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
7 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
8 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
9 seventy-two dollars;
10 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
11 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
12 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
13 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
14 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
15 seventy-two dollars; or
16 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
17 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for
18 the 2024-25 school year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen
19 percent each school year thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero,
20 and then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
21 4. After determining the product in accordance with subsection 3, the superintendent of
22 public instruction shall:
23 a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the
24 school district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this
25 subdivision may not exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for
26 purposes of this subdivision by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to
27 section 15.1-27-04.3; and
28 b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
29 subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for
30 seventy-five percent of all revenue types, the superintendent of public instruction
31 shall adjust revenues as follows:

5 funding consists of:
6 a. All state aid received by the district in accordance with chapter 15.1-27 during the

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 2024-25 school year when sixty-eight percent of tuition received under an
2 agreement to educate students from a school district on an air force base
3 with funding received through federal impact aid must be excluded from the
4 tuition calculation under this paragraph;
5 (4) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes on the distribution and transmission
6 of electric power;
7 (5) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes on electricity generated from
8 sources other than coal; and

18 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
19 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
20 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
21 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
22 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
23 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
24 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
25 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
26 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
27 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for
28 the 2020-21 school year and for each year thereafter.

3 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid.
4 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
5 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
6 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
7 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
8 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
9 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
10 district and for each year thereafter.
11 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
12 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
13 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
14 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
15 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
16 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
17 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
18 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
19 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
20 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
21 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
22 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
23 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
24 greater of:
25 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred

28 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
29 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
30 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the

1 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
2 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
3 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
4 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
5 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
6 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
7 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
8 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
9 seventy-two dollars;
10 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
11 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
12 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
13 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
14 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
15 seventy-two dollars; or
16 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
17 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for
18 the 2024-25 school year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen
19 percent each school year thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero,
20 and then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
21 4. After determining the product in accordance with subsection 3, the superintendent of
22 public instruction shall:
23 a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the
24 school district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this
25 subdivision may not exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for
26 purposes of this subdivision by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to
27 section 15.1-27-04.3; and
28 b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
29 subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for
30 seventy-five percent of all revenue types, the superintendent of public instruction
31 shall adjust revenues as follows:

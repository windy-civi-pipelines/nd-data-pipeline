10 1. The minimum reasonable budget for each operation must be determined by adding

17 from the operation's budget calculated under subsection 1:
18 a. The product of the operation's average number of runs for the two most recent
19 calendar years multiplied by the reimbursement for a run. The reimbursement for
20 a run is seven hundred ninety-five dollars; and
21 b. The product of the property tax valuation of the operation's response area for the
22 most recent taxable year multiplied by five mills. The property tax valuation of the

5 4. The department shall distribute a prorated share of the operation's calculated grant
6 amount if legislative appropriations for state financial assistance for emergency
7 medical services is not sufficient to provide full grant funding calculated under this
8 section.
9 5. An operation is eligible to receive funding under this section if the operation is owned
10 and operated by a city or county, or the operation is within the jurisdiction of a rural
11 ambulance service district. An operation is not eligible to receive funding under this
12 section if the operation is located within fifteen miles from another operation and does
13 less than fifty runs per year.
14 6. A response area acquired after April 1, 2024, due to an adjacent ambulance service
15 closure is not calculated in the operations response area for the purpose of the grant

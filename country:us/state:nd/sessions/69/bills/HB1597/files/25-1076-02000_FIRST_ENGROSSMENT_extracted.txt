8 amounts distributed through June 30, 2026, the minimum total grant calculation for
9 each operation, after accounting for the deductions in subsection 2, must be at least
10 fifty percent of the previous year's grant amount, but not more than the amount
11 calculated in subsection 1.
12 5. The department shall distribute a prorated share of the operation's calculated grant
13 amount if legislative appropriations for state financial assistance for emergency
14 medical services is not sufficient to provide full grant funding calculated under this
15 section.
16 6. An operation is not eligible to receive funding under this section if the operation does
17 more than eight hundred runs per year.
18 7. A response area acquired after April 1, 2024, due to an adjacent ambulance service
19 closure is not calculated in the operations response area for the purpose of the grant

4 SECTION 1. EXEMPTION - AMBULANCE SERVICE OPERATION FUNDING
5 DISTRIBUTION. Notwithstanding section 23-46-04 relating to state financial assistance for
6 emergency medical services, during the biennium beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30,
7 2027, the department of health and human services, in consultation with the emergency
8 medical services advisory council, shall provide state financial assistance to each eligible
9 ambulance service operation pursuant to the following calculation:
10 1. The minimum reasonable budget for each operation must be determined by adding
11 the product of the operation's average number of runs for the two most recent
12 calendar years multiplied by the cost of a run. The cost of a run for this biennium is
13 two thousand twenty-three dollars. If the average runs multiplied by the cost of a run
14 equals less than one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, the minimum reasonable
15 budget for that ambulance service is one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars. The
16 grant amount must be the lesser of:
17 a. The calculation in subsection 2; or
18 b. The cost of a run multiplied by the average number of runs.
19 2. The operation's grant amount must be determined by deducting the following amounts
20 from the operation's budget calculated under subsection 1:

2 calendar years multiplied by the reimbursement for a run. The reimbursement for
3 a run is seven hundred ninety-five dollars; and

7 later than July thirty-first. If the response area covers multiple counties, the
8 county auditor with the most response area is responsible for coordinating with
9 the other county auditors.

11 deductions in subsection 2, may not exceed two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars.
12 4. The maximum reimbursement for a run is two thousand twenty-three dollars.
13 Notwithstanding subsection 5, for grant amounts distributed through June 30, 2027,
14 the minimum total grant calculation for each operation, after accounting for the
15 deductions in subsection 2, must be at least fifty percent of the previous year's grant
16 amount, but not more than the amount calculated in subsection 1.
17 5. The department shall distribute a prorated share of the operation's calculated grant
18 amount if legislative appropriations for state financial assistance for emergency
19 medical services is not sufficient to provide full grant funding calculated under this
20 section.
21 6. An operation is not eligible to receive funding under this section if the operation does
22 more than eight hundred runs per year.
23 7. A response area acquired after April 1, 2024, due to an adjacent ambulance service
24 closure is not calculated in the operations response area for the purpose of the grant
25 calculation.

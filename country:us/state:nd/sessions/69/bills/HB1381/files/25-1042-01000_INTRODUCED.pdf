1 e. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year, the superintendent shall reduce the
2 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
3 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
4 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
5 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
6 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
7 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
8 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
9 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
10 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
11 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for
12 the 2020-21 school year and for each year thereafter.
13 2. a. The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
14 subsection 1 by the district's 2017-18 weighted student units to determine the
15 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit.
16 b. For any school district that becomes an elementary district pursuant to section
17 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the
18 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid.
19 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
20 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
21 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
22 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
23 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
24 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
25 district and for each year thereafter.
26 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
27 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
28 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
29 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
30 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
31 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
Page No. 3 25.1042.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
2 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
3 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
4 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
5 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
6 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
7 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
8 greater of:
9 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred
10 forty-six dollars;
11 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
12 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
13 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
14 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
15 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
16 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
17 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
18 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
19 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
20 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
21 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
22 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
23 seventy-two dollars;
24 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
25 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
26 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
27 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
28 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
29 seventy-two dollars; or
30 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
31 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for
Page No. 4 25.1042.01000

1 the 2024-25 school year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen
2 percent each school year thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero,
3 and then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
4 4. After determining the product in accordance with subsection 3, the superintendent of
5 public instruction shall:
6 a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the
7 school district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this
8 subdivision may not exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for
9 purposes of this subdivision by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to
10 section 15.1-27-04.3; and
11 b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
12 subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for
13 seventy-five percent of all revenue types, the superintendent of public instruction
14 shall adjust revenues as follows:
15 (1) Tuition revenue shall be adjusted as follows:
16 (a) In addition to deducting tuition revenue received specifically for the
17 operation of an educational program provided at a residential
18 treatment facility, tuition revenue received for the provision of an adult
19 farm management program, tuition received for the education of
20 high-cost and special education students, and tuition received under
21 an agreement to educate students from a school district on an
22 air force base with funding received through federal impact aid as

24 subsection 1, the superintendent of public instruction also shall reduce
25 the total tuition reported by the school district by the amount of tuition
26 revenue received for the education of students not residing in the
27 state and for which the state has not entered a cross-border education
28 contract; and
29 (b) The superintendent of public instruction also shall reduce the total

10 requirements or limitations.
11 6. On or before June thirtieth of each year, the school board shall certify to the
12 superintendent of public instruction the final average daily membership for the current
13 school year.

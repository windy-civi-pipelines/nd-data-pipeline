4 SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 61-32-03 of the North Dakota Century Code is
5 amended and reenacted as follows:
6 61-32-03. Permit to drain waters required - Penalty.
7 1. Any person, before draining a pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or any series thereof,
8 which has a watershed area comprising eighty acres [32.37 hectares] or more, shall
9 first secure a drainage permit to do so. Any person, before draining a pond, slough,
10 lake, or sheetwater, which has a watershed area comprising less than eighty acres
11 [32.37 hectares] but from which the drainage flows directly onto the property of
12 another landowner without first obtaining prior written consent from the downstream
13 landowner, shall first secure a drainage permit.
14 2. The permit application must be submitted to the department of water resources. The
15 department shall refer the application to the water resource district or districts within
16 which is found a majority of the watershed or drainage area of the pond, slough, lake,
17 or sheetwater for consideration and approval, but the department may require
18 applications proposing drainage of statewide or interdistrict significance be returned to
19 the department for final approval.
20 3. A permit may not be granted until an investigation discloses the quantity of water
21 which will be drained from the pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or any series of those
22 water bodies, will not flood or adversely affect downstream lands. If the investigation
23 shows the proposed drainage will flood or adversely affect lands of downstream
24 landowners, the water resource board may not issue a permit until flowage easements

2 recorder of the county or counties in which the lands are situated. An owner of land
3 proposing to drain shall undertake and agree to pay the expenses incurred in making
4 the required investigation. This section does not apply to the construction or

6 a state or federal agency, as determined by the department of water resources.
7 4. Any person draining, or causing to be drained, a pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or

9 [32.37 hectares] or more, without first securing a permit to do so, as provided by this
10 section, is liable for all damage sustained by any person caused by the draining, and
11 is guilty of an infraction. As used in this section, sheetwater means shallow water that

12 c. If the downstream landowner:
13 (1) Fails to timely deliver the written objection, the person may install the
14 subsurface water management system.
15 (2) Timely delivers the written objection, the water resource district in which the

26 benefits the property receives, provided the property is not assessed already for the
27 assessment drain. The water resource district also may include the property in the
28 assessment district and determine the benefits and assessment amounts under
29 chapters 61-21 and 61-16.1, without conducting the reassessment of benefit
30 proceedings under sections 61-21-44 and 61-16.1-26, provided the property is not

4 employee with respect to application, hiring, training, apprenticeship, tenure,
5 promotion, upgrading, compensation, layoff, or a term, privilege, or condition of
6 employment, because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or
7 mental disability, health status, status with respect to marriage or public assistance, or

15 accommodation that would disrupt or interfere with the employer's normal business
16 operations; threaten an individual's health or safety; contradict a business necessity of
17 the employer; or impose an undue hardship on the employer, taking into consideration
18 the size of the employer's business, the type of business, the financial resources of

20 of this subsection, "pregnant" includes pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical
21 conditions.

23 attained sixty-five years of age, but not seventy years of age, and who, for the
24 two-year period immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or
25 high policymaking position, if the employee is entitled to an immediate nonforfeiture
26 annual retirement benefit from a pension, profit-sharing, savings, or deferred
27 compensation plan, or any combination of those plans, of the employer of the
28 employee, which equal, in the aggregate, at least forty-four thousand dollars.

20 privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system, or a system which
21 measures earnings by quantity or quality of production or to employees who work in different
22 locations provided that the differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because
23 of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, health status,
24 status with respect to marriage or public assistance, or participation in lawful activity off the
25 employer's premises during nonworking hours; or for an employer to give and to act upon the
26 results of any professionally developed ability test; provided, that the test, its administration, or
27 action upon the results is not designed, intended, or used to discriminate because of race, color,
28 religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, health status, status with respect
29 to marriage or public assistance, or participation in a lawful activity off the employer's premises

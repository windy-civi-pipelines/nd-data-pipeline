12 authorized insurer or a disclaimer may be filed by the insurer or any member of an
13 insurance holding company system. The disclaimer must fully disclose all material
14 relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as
15 the basis for disclaiming the affiliation. A disclaimer of affiliation is deemed to have
16 been granted unless the commissioner, within thirty days following receipt of a
17 complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is disallowed. In the event of
18 disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which must
19 be granted. The disclaiming party is relieved of its duty to register under this section if
20 approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner or if the disclaimer is
21 deemed to have been approved.

23 registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.

8 with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent or more of the voting
9 securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made
10 in accordance with subsection 9 that control does not exist in fact. The commissioner
11 may determine, after providing all interested persons notice and opportunity to be
12 heard and making specific findings of fact to support the determination, that control
13 exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a presumption to that effect.
14 15. A person that would otherwise have control may delegate control to one or more other
15 persons under a delegation agreement that must be substantially in the form
16 designated by the commissioner so the person delegating the control will no longer be

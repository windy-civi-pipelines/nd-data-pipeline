3 allegations of child exploitation and abuse involving public officials, and severe penalties for
4 public officials who engage in, enable, or conceal child exploitation.
5 WHEREAS, the protection of children and vulnerable populations is a fundamental
6 responsibility of government; and
7 WHEREAS, individuals entrusted with positions of leadership and authority bear a greater
8 responsibility to uphold justice and protect the vulnerable, as noted in Luke 12:48, "From
9 everyone who has been given so much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has
10 been entrusted with much, much more will be asked"; and
11 WHEREAS, child exploitation, abuse, and trafficking are among the most heinous crimes,
12 as noted in Matthew 18:6, "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
13 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in
14 the depth of the sea"; and
15 WHEREAS, a public official who participates in, enables, or knowingly conceals child
16 exploitation has betrayed his or her oath of office, contributed to the destruction of innocent
17 lives, and allowed evil to thrive under the protection of power and privilege; and
18 WHEREAS, the concealment of and participation in child exploitation within governmental
19 institutions represents a severe breach of duty that demands heightened accountability,
20 including criminal penalties and permanent removal from public service;
21 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
22 NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
23 That the Legislative Management consider studying the feasibility of establishing mandatory

13 Equal residential responsibility - When awarded .
14 1. Unless the court determines a parent is unfit to care for a child in accordance with

16 residential responsibility inappropriate, a court must grant the parents equal residential
17 responsibility of a child.
18 2. If the court determines the parents' residences are separated by a distance that would
19 make an award of equal residential responsibility detrimental to the physical or

21 other parent, the court must grant the maximum amount of parenting time possible to
22 the parent who is not awarded primary residential responsibility of the child .

31 of the child.

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 5. If a parent is unable to provide proper care for a child with a special need, as
2 documented by a child development expert, and an award of equal residential
3 responsibility would be detrimental to the physical or emotional health of the child, the
4 court shall determine a parenting schedule that is in the best interests of the child.
5 6. If the parties agree through mediation to deviate from equal residential responsibility,
6 the court must give consideration to the preference of the parties unless the
7 agreement is determined by the court to be detrimental to the emotional or physical
8 health of the child.
9 SECTION 6. AMENDMENT. Section 14-09-06.2 of the North Dakota Century Code is
10 amended and reenacted as follows:
11 14-09-06.2. Best interests and welfare of child - Court consideration - Factors.
12 1. For the purpose of parental rights and responsibilities, the best interests and welfare of
13 the child is determined by the court's consideration and evaluation of all factors
14 affecting the best interests and welfare of the child. These factors may not be
15 considered unless the court determines a parent is unfit to care for a child under
16 section 3 of this Act or the court determines an award of equal residential responsibility
17 is inappropriate under section 5 of this Act. These factors include all of the following
18 when applicable:
19 a. The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the parents and
20 child and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, love,
21 affection, and guidance.
22 b. The ability of each parent to assure that the child receives adequate food,
23 clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment.
24 c. The child's developmental needs and the ability of each parent to meet those
25 needs, both in the present and in the future.
26 d. The sufficiency and stability of each parent's home environment, the impact of
27 extended family, the length of time the child has lived in each parent's home, and
28 the desirability of maintaining continuity in the child's home and community.
29 e. The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and
30 continuing relationship between the other parent and the child.
31 f. The moral fitness of the parents, as that fitness impacts the child.
Page No. 4 25.0774.03000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 g. The mental and physical health of the parents, as that health impacts the child.
2 h.g. The home, school, and community records of the child and the potential effect of
3 any change.
4 i.h. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a child is of sufficient
5 maturity to make a sound judgment, the court may give substantial weight to the
6 preference of the mature child. The court also shall give due consideration to
7 other factors that may have affected the child's preference, including whether the
8 child's preference was based on undesirable or improper influences.
9 j.i. Evidence of domestic violence. In determining parental rights and responsibilities,
10 the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence. If the court finds credible
11 evidence that domestic violence has occurred, and there exists one incident of
12 domestic violence which resulted in serious bodily injury or involved the use of a
13 dangerous weapon or there exists a pattern of domestic violence within a
14 reasonable time proximate to the proceeding, this combination creates a
15 rebuttable presumption that a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence may
16 not be awarded residential responsibility for the child. This presumption may be
17 overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the
18 child require that parent have residential responsibility. The court shall cite
19 specific findings of fact to show that the residential responsibility best protects the
20 child and the parent or other family or household member who is the victim of
21 domestic violence. If necessary to protect the welfare of the child, residential
22 responsibility for a child may be awarded to a suitable third person, provided that
23 the person would not allow access to a violent parent except as ordered by the
24 court. If the court awards residential responsibility to a third person, the court
25 shall give priority to the child's nearest suitable adult relative. The fact that the
26 abused parent suffers from the effects of the abuse may not be grounds for
27 denying that parent residential responsibility. As used in this subdivision,
28 "domestic violence" means domestic violence as defined in section 14-07.1-01. A
29 court may consider, but is not bound by, a finding of domestic violence in another
30 proceeding under chapter 14-07.1.
Page No. 5 25.0774.03000

Legislative Assembly
1 k.j. The interaction and inter-relationship, or the potential for interaction and inter-
2 relationship, of the child with any personindividual who resides in, is present, or
3 frequents the household of a parent and who may significantly affect the child's
4 best interests. The court shall consider that person'sindividual's history of self-
5 harm and inflicting, or tendency to inflict, physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or
6 the fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, on other personsindividuals.
7 l.k. The making of false allegations not made in good faith, by one parent against the
8 other, of harm to a child.
9 m.l. Any other factors considered by the court to be relevant to a particular parental
10 rights and responsibilities dispute.
11 2. In a proceeding for parental rights and responsibilities of a child of a service member,
12 a court may not consider a parent's past deployment or possible future deployment in
13 itself in determining the best interests of the child but may consider any significant
14 impact on the best interests of the child of the parent's past or possible future
15 deployment.
16 3. In any proceeding under this chapter, the court, at any stage of the proceedings after
17 final judgment, may make orders about what security is to be given for the care,
18 custody, and support of the unmarried minor children of the marriage as from the
19 circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case is equitable.
20 SECTION 7. AMENDMENT. Section 14-09-07 of the North Dakota Century Code is
21 amended and reenacted as follows:
22 14-09-07. Residence of child.
23 1. The primary residence of a child or the relocation of a child to another state may not
24 be determined until the final judgment in an action. An interim order is not a final
25 judgment.
26 2. A parent with primary residential responsibility for a child may not change the primary
27 residence of the child to another state except upon order of the court or with the
28 written consent of the other parent, if the other parent has been given parenting time
29 by the decree.
30 2.3. A parent with equal residential responsibility for a child may not change the residence
31 of the child to another stateoutside of a fifty mile radius except with the written consent
Page No. 6 25.0774.03000

1 of the other parent or order of the court allowing the move and awarding that parent
2 primary residential responsibility.
3 3.4. A court order is not required if the other parent:
4 a. Has not, as established by clear and convincing evidence, exercised parenting
5 time for a period of one year; or
6 b. Has moved to another state and is more than fifty miles [80.47 kilometers] from
7 the residence of the parent with primary residential responsibility. If the other
8 parent is an active member of the armed forces, this subdivision does not apply.
9 SECTION 8. APPLICATION. This Act applies to each action involving a determination of
10 parental rights and responsibilities in which a child at issue in the action is under the age of
11 eighteen. The limitations under section 14-09-06.6 on postjudgment modifications of primary
12 residential responsibility, including the requirement that the moving party establish a prima facie
13 case, or material change in circumstance, justifying a modification, and under rule 8.2 of the
14 North Dakota Rules of Court on amending an interim order, do not apply to the first motion filed
15 in an action on or after the effective date of this Act by a moving party seeking a determination
16 of parental rights and responsibilities under the presumption and evidentiary burden established
17 by this Act.

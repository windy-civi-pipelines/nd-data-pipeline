SECTION 2. AMENDMENT. Section 12.1-17-07.1 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended
and reenacted as follows:
12.1-17-07.1. Stalking.
1. As used in this section:
a. "Course of conduct" means a pattern of conduct consisting of two or more acts
evidencing a continuity of purpose. The term includes an act conducted with a robot in
the direct control of the person. The term does not include constitutionally protected
activity.
b. "Immediate family" means a spouse, parent, child, or sibling. The term also includes any
other individual who regularly resides in the household or who within the prior six months
regularly resided in the household.
c. "Robot" means an artificial object or system that senses, processes, and acts using
technology, including the associated elements, communication links, and artificial
intelligence. The term includes remotely piloted aircraft.
d. "Stalk" means:
(1) To engage in an intentional course of conduct directed at a specific person which
frightens, intimidates, or harasses that person and which serves no legitimate
purpose. The course of conduct may be directed toward that person or a member of
that person's immediate family and must cause a reasonable person to experience
fear, intimidation, or harassment; or
(2) The unauthorized tracking of the person's movements or location through the use of
a global positioning system, robot, or other electronic means that would cause a
reasonable person to be frightened, intimidated, or harassed and which serves no
legitimate purpose.
2. A person may not intentionally stalk another person.
3. In any prosecution under this section, it is not a defense that the actor was not given actual
notice that the person did not want the actor to contact or follow the person; nor is it a defense
that the actor did not intend to frighten, intimidate, or harass the person. An attempt to contact
or follow a person after being given actual notice that the person does not want to be
contacted or followed is prima facie evidence that the actor intends to stalk that person.
4. In any prosecution under this section, it is a defense that a private investigator licensed under
chapter 43-30 or a peace officer licensed under chapter 12-63 was acting within the scope of
employment.
5. If a person claims to have been engaged in a constitutionally protected activity, the court shall
determine the validity of the claim as a matter of law and, if found valid, shall exclude evidence
of the activity.
6. a. A person who violates this section is guilty of a class C felony if:
(1) The person previously has been convicted of violating section 12.1-17-01,
12.1-17-01.1, 12.1-17-01.2, 12.1-17-02, 12.1-17-04, 12.1-17-05, or 12.1-17-07, or a
similar offense from another court in North Dakota, a court of record in the United
States, or a tribal court, involving the victim of the stalking;

H. B. NO. 1429 - PAGE 3

victim of the stalking, if the person had notice of the court order; or
(3) The person previously has been convicted of violating this section.
b. If subdivision a does not apply, a person who violates this section is guilty of a class A

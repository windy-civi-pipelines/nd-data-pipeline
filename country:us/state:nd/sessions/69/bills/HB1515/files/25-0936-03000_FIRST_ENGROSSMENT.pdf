11 work and service for the work performed. The hourly labor rate paid by a motor
12 vehicle manufacturer to the dealer for warranty services mayreasonably

14 with the following manufacturer or distributor sponsored, issued, or required
15 items:

1 (7) Service contracts.
2 (8) Parts exchange programs.
3 (9) Recall, goodwill, and warranty work performed by the dealer.
4 b. Reasonable compensation for labor for the services identified in subdivision a
5 may not be less than the average retail rate charged by the dealer for like service
6 to nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty service as provided under
7 subsection 5. A motor vehicle manufacturer may not reimburse a dealer for parts
8 used in the performance of warranty repair at a lower rate multiplied by the time
9 guide used by the dealer for nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders. To
10 establish a time guide, a dealer shall provide written notice to the manufacturer or
11 distributor with the name of the time guide the dealer uses. The manufacturer or
12 distributor may not require the dealer to provide any other information to establish
13 the time guide the dealer uses. If no time guide exists for a warranty repair,
14 compensation for warranty labor must equal the dealer's average retail rate
15 multiplied by the time spent to complete the repair, and may not be less than the
16 time charged to a retail customer for the same or similar work provided. A dealer
17 shall use time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of work and service
18 which are reasonable and adequate for a qualified technician to perform the work
19 or services. Reasonable compensation for parts for the services identified in
20 subdivision a may not be less than the average retail rate customarily charged by
21 the dealer for these parts as provided under subsection 4.
22 2. A dealer shall submit a claim for reimbursement for services within ninety days from
23 the completion of the services identified in subdivision a of subsection 1 . A motor
24 vehicle manufacturer or distributor shall pay a dealer on a claim made by a dealer
25 under this section within thirty days of the approval of the claim. The manufacturer or
26 distributor shall either approve or disapprove a claim within thirty days after the claim
27 is submitted to the manufacturer or distributor. The manufacturer or distributor may
28 prescribe the manner in which and the forms on which the dealer must present the
29 claim. A claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after the
30 manufacturer or distributor receives the claim must be construed to be approved and
31 the manufacturer or distributor shall pay the claim within thirty days. If a manufacturer

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 or distributor disapproves a claim in writing within thirty days, the manufacturer or
2 distributor shall contemporaneously provide the dealer with a detailed written
3 explanation of the reason the claim was disapproved. The dealer has thirty days from
4 the receipt of the disapproval to resubmit a corrected claim.
5 3. A motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, or distributor, or distributor branch shall
6 fully compensate its motor vehicle dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts,
7 work, and serviceand labor specified in this section. Failure to fully compensate
8 includes a reduction in the amount due under this section to the dealer or imposing a
9 separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition by which the motor vehicle
10 manufacturer, factory branch, or distributor, or distributor branch seeks to recover the
11 costs of complying with this section from the dealer.
12 4. The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts is established by the dealer
13 submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential nonwarranty
14 customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts or ninety
15 consecutive days of nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain
16 warranty-like parts, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one
17 hundred eighty days before the submission and declaring the average percentage
18 markup.
19 5. The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for labor must be established using
20 the same process as provided under subsection 4 and declaring the average labor
21 rate. The average labor rate must be determined by dividing the amount of the
22 dealer's total labor sales by the number of total hours that generated those sales. If a
23 labor rate and parts markup rate are simultaneously declared by the dealer, the dealer
24 may use the same repair orders to complete each calculation as provided under
25 subsection 4.
26 6. In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor as
27 provided in subsections 4 and 5 , the following work may not be included in the
28 calculation:
29 a. Repairs for manufacturer or distributor special events, specials, or promotional
30 discounts for retail customer repairs;

19 subsections 4 and 6 is presumed to be fair and reasonable and must go into
20 effect thirty days following the manufacturer's approvalreceipt of the submission
21 subject to the manufacturer or distributor's ability to contest the rate as provided
22 in this subsection. The motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor may not issue
23 more than one notice to the dealer contesting any declared labor rate or parts
24 markup, and may not add to, expand, supplement, or otherwise modify any
25 reason for contesting the declared rate or parts markup. A manufacturer or
26 distributor may rebut the presumption by reasonably substantiating that a rate is
27 unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers
28 in an economically similar area of the state offering the dealer's declaration of the
29 same line-make vehicles, not later than thirty days after submission. If the
30 average parts markup rate or average labor rate is rebutted, or both, the
31 manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average

9 substantiating any written explanation.

14 provided in this section. This section applies to all proposed adjusted labor
15 rates or parts markups, even if the motor vehicle manufacturer's or
16 distributor's determination of the labor rate or parts markup is different from
17 the labor rate or parts markup provided in the dealer's submission.
18 b. If a motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor fails to comply with the
19 requirements of subdivision a within thirty days of receipt of submission, the
20 submission is approved.
21 c. If a dealer agrees with the conclusions of the motor vehicle manufacturer or
22 distributor and any corresponding adjustment to the labor rate or parts markup
23 contained within the written objection, no further action is required. The new
24 adjusted rate is effective thirty days after the dealer's submission is received by
25 the manufacturer or distributor.
26 d. If a motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor provides a written objection that
27 complies with the requirements under subdivision a, and the dealer does no t
28 agree with the proposed adjusted labor rate or parts markup contained within the
29 written objection, or if the dealer disputes the motor vehicle manufacturer or
30 distributor complied with the provisions of subdivision a, the dealer may bring an
31 action in a court of competent jurisdiction. In such proceeding:

12 attorney fees. If a court finds the motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor
13 willfully violated this section, the dealer is entitled to recover three times the
14 amount of the retroactive labor rate or parts markup.

26 may not be made within twelve months of the last labor rate declaration. If a parts

6 greater of:
7 (1) The amount the dealer paid for the part or a substantially identical part if

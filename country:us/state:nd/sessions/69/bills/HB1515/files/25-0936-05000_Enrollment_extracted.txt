diagnostic work, as well as repair service, parts, and labor, in warranty work
compensation. In addition, a motor vehicle manufacturer shall provide adequate time
allowances for diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service for the work

customers for nonwarranty service as provided under subsection 5. A motor vehicle
manufacturer may not reimburse a dealer for parts used in the performance of warranty
repair at a lower rate multiplied by the time guide used by the dealer for nonwarranty
customer-paid service repair orders. To establish a time guide, a dealer shall provide
written notice to the manufacturer or distributor with the name of the time guide the
dealer uses. The manufacturer or distributor may not require the dealer to provide any
other information to establish the time guide the dealer uses. If no time guide exists for a

construed to be approved and the manufacturer or distributor shall pay the claim within thirty
days. If a manufacturer or distributor disapproves a claim in writing within thirty days, the
manufacturer or distributor shall contemporaneously provide the dealer with a detailed written
explanation of the reason the claim was disapproved. The dealer has thirty days from the
receipt of the disapproval to resubmit a corrected claim.

Section 5:
3. A motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, or distributor, or distributor branch shall fully
compensate its motor vehicle dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts, work, and
serviceand labor specified in this section. Failure to fully compensate includes a reduction in

other imposition by which the motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, or distributor, or
distributor branch seeks to recover the costs of complying with this section from the dealer.

Section 6:
4. The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts is established by the dealer
submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential nonwarranty
customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts or ninety consecutive days
of nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts, whichever
is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty days before the submission
and declaring the average percentage markup.

Section 7:
5. The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for labor must be established using the same
process as provided under subsection 4 and declaring the average labor rate. The average
labor rate must be determined by dividing the amount of the dealer's total labor sales by the
number of total hours that generated those sales. If a labor rate and parts markup rate are
simultaneously declared by the dealer, the dealer may use the same repair orders to complete
each calculation as provided under subsection 4.

Section 8:
6. In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor as provided

manufacturer or distributor's ability to contest the rate as provided in this subsection. The
motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor may not issue more than one notice to the
dealer contesting any declared labor rate or parts markup, and may not add to, expand,
supplement, or otherwise modify any reason for contesting the declared rate or parts
markup. A manufacturer or distributor may rebut the presumption by reasonably
substantiating that a rate is unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised
motor vehicle dealers in an economically similar area of the state offering the dealer's
declaration of the same line-make vehicles, not later than thirty days after submission. If
the average parts markup rate or average labor rate is rebutted, or both, the
manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average percentage
markup based on that rebuttal not later than thirty days after submission.contest the

rate or parts markup is different from the labor rate or parts markup provided in the
dealer's submission.
b. If a motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor fails to comply with the requirements of
subdivision a within thirty days of receipt of submission, the submission is approved .
c. If a dealer agrees with the conclusions of the motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor
and any corresponding adjustment to the labor rate or parts markup contained within the
H. B. NO. 1515 - PAGE 4
written objection, no further action is required. The new adjusted rate is effective thirty
days after the dealer's submission is received by the manufacturer or distributor.
d. If a motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor provides a written objection that complies
with the requirements under subdivision a, and the dealer does not agree with the
proposed adjusted labor rate or parts markup contained within the written objection, or if
the dealer disputes the motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor complied with the
provisions of subdivision a, the dealer may bring an action in a court of competen t
jurisdiction. In such proceeding:
(1) The motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof by a
preponderance of the evidence, and must show:

finds the motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor willfully violated this section, the
dealer is entitled to recover three times the amount of the retroactive labor rate or
parts markup.

8. Each manufacturer, in establishing a schedule of compensation for warranty work, shall rely
on the vehicle dealer's written schedule of hourly labor rates and parts and may not obligate
any vehicle dealer to engage in unduly burdensome or time-consuming documentation of
rates or parts, including obligating vehicle dealers to engage in transaction-by-transaction or

parts markup must be calculated using the method prescribed in subsections 4 though 6 .

Section 12:
9. A dealer or, manufacturer, or distributor may demand that the average parts markup or
average labor rate be calculated using the process provided under subsections 4 and 5;
however, the demand for the average parts markup may not be made within twelve months of
the last parts markup declaration and the demand for the average labor rate may not be made
within twelve months of the last labor rate declaration. If a parts markup or labor rate is
demanded by the dealer or manufacturer or distributor, the dealer shall determine the repair
orders to be included in the calculation under subsections 4 and 5.

11. A motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor may not:
a. Require or influence or attempt to influence a dealer to implement or change the prices
for which it sells parts or labor in retail repairs.

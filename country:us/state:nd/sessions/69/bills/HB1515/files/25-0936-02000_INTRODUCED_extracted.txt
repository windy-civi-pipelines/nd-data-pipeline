14 time charged to a retail customer for the same or similar work provided.

29 manufacturer or distributor shall contemporaneously provide the dealer with a detailed
30 written explanation of the reason the claim was disapproved. The dealer has thirty
31 days from the receipt of the disapproval to resubmit a corrected claim.

4 reduction in the amount due under this section to the dealer or imposing a separate
5 charge, surcharge, or other imposition by which the motor vehicle manufacturer,
6 factory branch, or distributor, or distributor branch seeks to recover the costs of
7 complying with this section from the dealer.
8 4. The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts is established by the dealer
9 submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred sequential nonwarranty
10 customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts or ninety

19 labor rate and parts markup rate are simultaneously declared by the dealer, the dealer
20 may use the same repair orders to complete each calculation as provided under
21 subsection 4.

23 provided in subsections 4 and 5 , the following work may not be included in the
24 calculation:

26 discounts for retail customer repairs;
27 b. Parts sold at wholesale;
28 c. Parts or labor used in manufacturer or distributor sponsored programs that

18 effect thirty days following the manufacturer's approvalreceipt of the submission
19 subject to the manufacturer or distributor's ability to contest the rate as provided
20 in this subsection. The motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor may not issue
21 more than one notice to the dealer contesting any declared labor rate or parts
22 markup, and may not add to, expand, supplement, or otherwise modify any
23 reason for contesting the declared rate or parts markup. A manufacturer or
24 distributor may rebut the presumption by reasonably substantiating that a rate is
25 unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers
26 in an economically similar area of the state offering the dealer's declaration of the
27 same line-make vehicles, not later than thirty days after submission. If the
28 average parts markup rate or average labor rate is rebutted, or both, the
29 manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average

of North Dakota
Introduced by
Senators Myrdal, Van Oosting
Representatives Frelich, Grindberg, Karls, Steiner
1 A concurrent resolution urging the National Collegiate Athletic Association to revoke its
2 transgender student-athlete eligibility policy, which directly discriminates against female student
3 athletes in collegiate women's sports.
4 WHEREAS, athletic participation has an important, positive impact on young girls,
5 improving their physical, emotional, and psychological health, self-confidence, and discipline,
6 and providing opportunities for a future in collegiate sports; and
7 WHEREAS, women have been responsible for some of the greatest athletic feats in the
8 sports history of the United States, from the Olympic games to professional competition,
9 through opportunities to compete in collegiate sports; and
10 WHEREAS, the enactment of Title-IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [Pub. L. 92-
11 318; 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.] marked a pivotal moment in the federal support of women in
12 sports and applying to virtually all postsecondary institutions as recipients of federal financial
13 assistance; and
14 WHEREAS, there are fundamental and enduring biological differences between males and
15 females which put women at a competitive disadvantage in sports and jeopardize their safety
16 during competition; and
17 WHEREAS, in 2010 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) unilaterally
18 adopted a policy that enables biological males to participate on women's rosters and compete in
19 the women's sports category, a policy that continues today; and
20 WHEREAS, such a policy disproportionately affects female athletes; and
21 WHEREAS, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) has instituted new
22 policies to protect biological girls in sports and ensure that only student athletes whose
23 biological sex is female will be allowed to compete in NAIA-sponsored women's sports teams;

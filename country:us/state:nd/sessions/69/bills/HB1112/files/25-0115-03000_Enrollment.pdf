hundredths percent of final average salary multiplied by the number of years

e. Postponed retirement benefits are calculated as for single life benefits for those members
who retired on or after July 1, 1977.
f.e. Early retirement benefits are calculated as for single life benefits accrued to the date of
termination of employment, but must be actuarially reduced to account for benefit
payments beginning before the normal retirement date, as determined under
subsection 3. Except for a national guard security officer or firefighter, a firefighter, peace
officer, or correctional officer employed by a political subdivision, a firefighter or peace
officer employed by the state, or a supreme court or district court judge, early retirement
benefits for members first enrolled after December 31, 2015, are calculated for single life
benefits accrued to the date of termination of employment, but must be reduced by a

benefits only after having completed five years of eligible employment.

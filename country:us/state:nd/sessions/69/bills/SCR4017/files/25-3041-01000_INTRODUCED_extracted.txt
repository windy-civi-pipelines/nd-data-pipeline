Sixty-ninth
of North Dakota
Introduced by
Senators Enget, Hogan, Hogue, Klein, Mathern
1 A concurrent resolution recognizing pornography as a public health hazard.
2 WHEREAS, each day, countless people are exposed to sexually explicit content through a
3 wide range of media, and these consumers often are unaware of the health risks posed by such
4 material; and
5 WHEREAS, children are encountering pornography before their teens, and this early
6 exposure may lead to low self-esteem and body image disorders and an increased desire to
7 engage in risky sexual behavior; and
8 WHEREAS, in addition to promoting unhealthy sexual expectations, the adult entertainment
9 industry produces media that objectifies women and children, as well as depicts rape and
10 abuse; by associating violence with sexual gratification, these materials perpetuate the demand
11 for sex trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, and sexual abuse images; and
12 WHEREAS, pornography has been linked to detrimental health effects, including brain
13 development complications, emotional and medical afflictions, the inability to form and maintain
14 intimate relationships, and sexual addiction; these dangers not only affect people on an
15 individual level but also contribute to the degradation of the family unit, frequently leading to
16 marital dissatisfaction and infidelity; and
17 WHEREAS, the ubiquity of pornography has resulted in a host of societal problems and
18 potentially negative health effects, and it is of paramount importance that our leaders address
19 this critical public health issue;
20 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF NORTH DAKOTA, THE
21 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN:
22 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly hereby recognize pornography as a public health
23 hazard, and recognize the need for education, prevention, research, and policy changes to
24 address the harmful influence and consequences of pornography; and

SECTION 16. AMENDMENT. Section 25-16.1-02 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended

25-16.1-02. Conditions for appointment of receiver.
When the department has revoked the license of a treatment or care centerprovider agency, or
when the operator of a centerprovider agency has requested, the department may file a petition with the
district court to place the centerprovider agency under the control of a receiver if necessary to protect
the health or safety of clients at the centerprovider agency. The court may grant the petition upon a
finding that the health or safety of the clients at the centerprovider agency would be seriously
threatened if a condition existing at the time the petition was filed is permitted to continue. Such a
finding may be based upon evidence concerning the physical plant, the program and services offered
by the centerprovider agency, but not solely upon evidence that a centerprovider agency:
1. Has been denied a license to operate as a centerprovider agency, or has had a previously
issued license revoked; or
2. Has been denied certification as an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual
disabilities, or has lost or had revoked such certification.

The court shall appoint, as receiver, the executive directorcommissioner of the department who
shall designate a qualified individual not employed by this state or its political subdivisions, or a
nonprofit organization to execute the receivership. The receiver appointed by the court shall use the
income and assets of the treatment or care centerprovider agency to maintain and operate the
centerprovider agency and to attempt to correct the conditions which constitute a threat to the clients.
The receiver may not liquidate the assets of the treatment or care centerprovider agency.
SECTION 18. AMENDMENT. Section 25-16.1-04 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended
and reenacted as follows:
25-16.1-04. Termination of receivership.
The receivership shall be terminated when the receiver and the court certify that the conditions
which prompted the appointment have been corrected, when the license is restored, when a new
license is issued, or, in the case of an election by the owner or owners to discontinue operation, when
the clients are safely placed or provided services in other centersprovider agencies.
SECTION 19. REPEAL. Chapter 25-18 of the North Dakota Century Code is repealed.
SECTION 20. EMERGENCY. This Act is declared to be an emergency measure.

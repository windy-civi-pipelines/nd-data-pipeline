of this chapter, are not volunteer firefighters.
The term "emergency or disaster volunteer" means any individual serving without remuneration
who is actively engaged in training to qualify as a disaster emergency worker or is responding to a

emergency organization of a municipality, which has been officially recognized by the director of the

qualification as a disaster emergency worker in the event of a hazard, emergency, disaster, or enemy
attack on this country.
The term "community emergency response team member" means an individual registered as a
community emergency response team member with the appropriate authority. For purposes of this

emergency or disaster.
Upon request of the organization, the disaster emergency organization of a municipality shall
provide the organization with its roster of registered community emergency response team members.
The term "municipality" when used in reference to emergency or disaster volunteer means the

agency's requirement to enter the order in the national crime information center database
provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency, but will not fulfill
its requirement to maintain and respond to inquiries regarding the order in the national

on the ice without a registration number, or an owner's name and address or telephone
number may be removed or destroyed by the department. The department may not issue a

weather conditions which present danger of precipitation or other climatic activity severe enough to

necessary by the governor, the governor may apply to the state emergency commission for a grant of
funds in an amount equal to the response and recovery costs of the state. Notwithstanding other
provisions of chapter 54-16, it must be conclusively presumed upon receipt by the emergency
commission of the application from the governor that a disaster or emergency exists, and the
commission may grant and direct the transfer to the department of the governor designated
representative of an amount up to that certified in the application by the governor.
SECTION 16. AMENDMENT. Subsection 3 of section 37-17.1-28 of the North Dakota Century

of this chapter, are not volunteer firefighters.
The term "emergency or disaster volunteer" means any individual serving without remuneration
who is actively engaged in training to qualify as a disaster emergency worker or is responding to a

emergency organization of a municipality, which has been officially recognized by the director of the
state division of homeland security and emergency management.
The term "in training" means only those periods of time, during which an emergency or disaster

qualification as a disaster emergency worker in the event of a hazard, emergency, disaster, or enemy
attack on this country.
The term "community emergency response team member" means an individual registered as a

Upon request of the organization, the disaster emergency organization of a municipality shall
provide the organization with its roster of registered community emergency response team members.
The term "municipality" when used in reference to emergency or disaster volunteer means the
state, cities, counties, municipalities, districts, or any other geographical entity of this state. This
definition is not in any way intended to alter any interpretation or ruling in regard to the use of the term
municipality when used in reference to volunteer firefighters.

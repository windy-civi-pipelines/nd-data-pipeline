number of weighted student units in the grades that are offered through another school
district relative to the total number of weighted student units the school district offered in
the year before the school district became an elementary district. The reduced baseline
funding applies to the calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school
district becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the superintendent shall
use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for the 2020-21 school year and
for each year thereafter.
2. a. The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in subsection 1
by the district's 2017-18 weighted student units to determine the district's baseline
funding per weighted student unit.

15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the district's
baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid. The
superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in subsection 1 by
the district's weighted student units after the school district becomes an elementary

student unit in the calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school
district becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter.
c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student unit.
Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the district's baseline
funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit
provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the superintendent shall reduce
the district's baseline funding per weighted student unit by forty percent of the amount by
which the district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
weighted student unit for the 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction
percentage is increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline

H. B. NO. 1369 - PAGE 3
funding per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the greater
of:
(1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred forty-six

unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's weighted student
units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline weighted student units, plus any
weighted student units in excess of the 2017-18 baseline weighted student units

paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and then the difference
added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.

calculate state aid as the greater of:
(1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand seventy-two
dollars;
(2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted student
unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's weighted student
units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline weighted student units, plus any
weighted student units in excess of the 2017-18 baseline weighted student units
multiplied by eleven thousand seventy-two dollars; or
(3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the amount in
paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for the 2024-25 school
year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen percent each school year
thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero, and then the difference added to
the amount determined in paragraph 1.
4. After determining the product in accordance with subsection 3, the superintendent of public
instruction shall:
a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the school
district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this subdivision may not
exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this subdivision
by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to section 15.1-27-04.3; and
b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for seventy-five

of an educational program provided at a residential treatment facility, tuition

reduce all remaining revenues from all revenue types by the percentage of mills

and reenacted as follows:
48-01.2-02.1. Public improvement construction threshold.
1. The threshold for bidding construction of a public improvement is two hundred fifty thousand
dollars. The threshold for procuring plans, drawings, and specifications from an architect or
engineer for construction of a public improvement is two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
2. Notwithstanding the thresholds in subsection 1, if the state or a political subdivision

engineering or architectural services are necessary to protect the health, safety, or welfare of
the public, the state or political subdivision shall consider consulting with an engineer or
architect.
SECTION 6. AMENDMENT. Section 48-01.2-10 of the North Dakota Century Code is amended and
reenacted as follows:
48-01.2-10. Bonds from contractors for public improvements.
1. Unless otherwise provided under this chapter, a governing body authorized to enter a contract
for the construction of a public improvement in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars
shall take from the contractor a bond before permitting any work to be done on the contract.
The bond must be for an amount equal at least to the price stated in the contract. The bond
must be conditioned to be void if the contractor and all subcontractors fully perform all terms,
conditions, and provisions of the contract and pay all bills or claims on account of labor
performed and any supplies, and materials furnished and used in the performance of the
contract, including all demands of subcontractors. The requirement that bills and claims be
paid must include the requirement that interest of the amount authorized under section
13-01-14 be paid on bills and claims not paid within ninety days. The bond is security for all
bills, claims, and demands until fully paid, with preference to labor and material suppliers as to
payment. The bond must run to the governing body, but any person having a lawful claim
against the contractor or any subcontractor may sue on the bond.
2. A governing body may not require any person required to provide a surety bond to obtain the
surety bond from a specified insurance or surety company or insurance producer or to submit
financial data to the company or producer.

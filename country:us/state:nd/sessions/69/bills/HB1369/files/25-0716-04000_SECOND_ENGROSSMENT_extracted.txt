4 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
5 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
6 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
7 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
8 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
9 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
10 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
11 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
12 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
13 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for

15 2. a. The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
16 subsection 1 by the district's 2017-18 weighted student units to determine the
17 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit.
18 b. For any school district that becomes an elementary district pursuant to section
19 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the

21 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
22 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
23 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
24 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
25 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
26 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
27 district and for each year thereafter.
28 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
29 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
30 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
31 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
Page No. 3 25.0716.04000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
2 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
3 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
4 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
5 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
6 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
7 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
8 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
9 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
10 greater of:
11 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred
12 forty-six dollars;

14 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
15 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
16 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
17 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
18 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
19 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
20 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
21 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
22 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
23 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
24 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
25 seventy-two dollars;
26 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
27 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
28 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
29 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
30 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
31 seventy-two dollars; or

3 e. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year, the superintendent shall reduce the
4 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
5 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
6 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
7 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
8 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
9 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
10 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
11 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
12 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
13 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for

16 subsection 1 by the district's 2017-18 weighted student units to determine the
17 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit.
18 b. For any school district that becomes an elementary district pursuant to section
19 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the

21 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
22 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
23 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
24 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
25 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
26 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
27 district and for each year thereafter.
28 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
29 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
30 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
31 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
Page No. 3 25.0716.04000

1 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
2 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
3 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
4 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
5 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
6 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
7 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
8 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
9 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
10 greater of:
11 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred
12 forty-six dollars;
13 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
14 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
15 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline

17 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
18 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
19 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
20 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
21 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
22 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
23 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
24 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
25 seventy-two dollars;
26 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
27 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
28 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
29 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
30 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
31 seventy-two dollars; or

15 seventy-five percent of all revenue types, the superintendent of public instruction
16 shall adjust revenues as follows:
17 (1) Tuition revenue shall be adjusted as follows:
18 (a) In addition to deducting tuition revenue received specifically for the

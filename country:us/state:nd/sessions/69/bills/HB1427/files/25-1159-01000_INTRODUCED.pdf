9 49-22-02. Statement of policy.
10 The legislative assembly finds that the construction of energy conversion facilities and,
11 transmission facilities, and data centers affects the environment and the welfare of the citizens
12 of this state. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the location, construction, and operation of
13 energy conversion facilities and, transmission facilities, and data centers will produce minimal
14 adverse effects on the environment and upon the welfare of the citizens of this state by
15 providing that noan energy conversion facility or, transmission facility, or data center shall be
16 located, constructed, and operated within this state without a certificate of site compatibility or a
17 route permit acquired pursuant to this chapter. The legislative assembly hereby declares it to be
18 the policy of this state to site energy conversion facilities and data centers and to route
19 transmission facilities in an orderly manner compatible with environmental preservation and the
20 efficient use of resources. In accordance with this policy, sites and routes shallmust be chosen
21 which minimize adverse human and environmental impact while ensuring continuing system
22 reliability and integrity and ensuring that energy needs are met and fulfilled in an orderly and
23 timely fashion.

Each plate must be mounted in a visible manner that clearly displays the distinctive number assigned to
the vehicle and the name of the state on the plate. As far as is reasonably possible, the plates must at
all times be kept free and clear of mud, ice, or snow so as to be clearly visible and all number plates,
markers, or evidence of registration or licensing except for the current year must be removed from the
vehicle. All vehicle license plates issued by the department are the property of the department for the
period for which the plates are valid. An annual registration tab or sticker for the current registration
year must be displayed on each number plate, in the area designated by the department for the tab or
sticker, in those years for which tabs or stickers are issued in lieu of number plates.

the transferor may apply for duplicate plates. The department may establish procedures that
permit the transferor to assign the credit to the transferee if the transferor is the spouse, a
sibling, or a lineal ancestor or descendant of the transferee. Any remaining credit on a vehicle
owned by a leasing company must be credited to the lessee. One-twelfth of the annual fee

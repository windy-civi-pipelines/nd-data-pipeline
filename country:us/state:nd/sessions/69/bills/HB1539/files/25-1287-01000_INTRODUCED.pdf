1 (b) For an electric energy conversion facility constructed before April 9,
2 1975, within the geographic location on which the facility was built; or
3 (c) For an electric transmission facility constructed before April 9, 1975,
4 within a width of three hundred fifty feet [106.68 meters] on either side
5 of the centerline;
6 (2) Except as provided in subdivision b, the activities do not affect any known
7 exclusion or avoidance area;
8 (3) The activities are for the construction:
9 (a) Of a new electric energy conversion facility;
10 (b) Of a new electric transmission facility;
11 (c) To improve the existing electric energy conversion facility or electric
12 transmission facility; or
13 (d) To increase or decrease the capacity of the existing electric energy
14 conversion facility or electric transmission facility; and
15 (4) Before conducting any activities, the utility certifies in writing to the
16 commission that:
17 (a) The activities will not affect a known exclusion or avoidance area;
18 (b) The activities are for the construction:
19 [1] Of a new electric energy conversion facility;
20 [2] Of a new electric transmission facility;
21 [3] To improve the existing electric energy conversion or electric
22 transmission facility; or
23 [4] To increase or decrease the capacity of the existing electric
24 energy conversion facility or electric transmission facility; and
25 (c) The utility will comply with all applicable conditions and protections in
26 siting laws and rules and commission orders previously issued for any
27 part of the facility.
28 b. Otherwise qualifying for exclusion under subdivision a, except that the activities
29 are expected to affect a known avoidance area and the utility before conducting

1 (a) The activities will not affect a known exclusion area;
2 (b) The activities are for the construction:
3 [1] Of a new electric energy conversion facility;
4 [2] Of a new electric transmission facility;
5 [3] To improve the existing electric energy conversion facility or
6 electric transmission facility; or
7 [4] To increase or decrease the capacity of the existing electric
8 energy conversion facility or electric transmission facility; and
9 (c) The utility will comply with all applicable conditions and protections in
10 siting laws and rules and commission orders previously issued for any
11 part of the facility;
12 (2) Notifies the commission in writing that the activities are expected to impact
13 an avoidance area and provides information on the specific avoidance area
14 expected to be impacted and the reasons why impact cannot be avoided;
15 and
16 (3) Receives the commission's written approval for the impact to the avoidance
17 area, based on a determination that there is no reasonable alternative to the
18 expected impact. If the commission does not approve impacting the
19 avoidance area, the utility must obtain siting authority under this chapter for
20 the affected portion of the site or route. If the commission fails to act on the
21 notification required by this subdivision within thirty days of the utility's filing
22 the notification, the impact to the avoidance area is deemed approved.
23 c. Incident to preliminary engineering or environmental studies.
24 4.5. "Corridor" means the area of land where a designated route may be established for an

reenacted as follows:
49-22-03. Definitions.
In this chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires:

Section 3:
1. "Backup electric generation" means electric generation that is not interconnected with the grid
and is generated on a temporary basis to replace primary source electric generation when
unavailable.

Section 4:
2. "Certificate" means the certificate of site compatibility or the certificate of corridor compatibility
issued under this chapter.

Section 5:
2.3. "Commission" means the North Dakota public service commission.

Section 6:
3.4. "Construction" includes a clearing of land, excavation, or other action affecting the
environment of the site after April 9, 1975, but does not include activities:
a. Conducted wholly within the geographic location for which a utility has previously
obtained a certificate or permit under this chapter, or on which a facility was constructed
before April 9, 1975, if:
(1) The activities are for the construction of the same type of facility as the existing type
of facility as identified in a subdivision of subsection 56 or 67 or in subsection 1314
of this section and the activities are:
(a) Within the geographic boundaries of a previously issued certificate or permit;
(b) For an electric energy conversion facility constructed before April 9, 1975,
within the geographic location on which the facility was built; or
(c) For an electric transmission facility constructed before April 9, 1975, within a
width of three hundred fifty feet [106.68 meters] on either side of the
centerline;
(2) Except as provided in subdivision b, the activities do not affect any known exclusion
or avoidance area;
(3) The activities are for the construction:
(a) Of a new electric energy conversion facility;
(b) Of a new electric transmission facility;
H. B. NO. 1539 - PAGE 2
(c) To improve the existing electric energy conversion facility or electric
transmission facility; or
(d) To increase or decrease the capacity of the existing electric energy
conversion facility or electric transmission facility; and
(4) Before conducting any activities, the utility certifies in writing to the commission that:
(a) The activities will not affect a known exclusion or avoidance area;
(b) The activities are for the construction:
[1] Of a new electric energy conversion facility;
[2] Of a new electric transmission facility;
[3] To improve the existing electric energy conversion or electric
transmission facility; or
[4] To increase or decrease the capacity of the existing electric energy
conversion facility or electric transmission facility; and
(c) The utility will comply with all applicable conditions and protections in siting
laws and rules and commission orders previously issued for any part of the
facility.
b. Otherwise qualifying for exclusion under subdivision a, except that the activities are
expected to affect a known avoidance area and the utility before conducting any
activities:
(1) Certifies in writing to the commission that:
(a) The activities will not affect a known exclusion area;

avoidance area and provides information on the specific avoidance area expected
to be impacted and the reasons why impact cannot be avoided; and
(3) Receives the commission's written approval for the impact to the avoidance area,
based on a determination that there is no reasonable alternative to the expected
impact. If the commission does not approve impacting the avoidance area, the utility
must obtain siting authority under this chapter for the affected portion of the site or
route. If the commission fails to act on the notification required by this subdivision

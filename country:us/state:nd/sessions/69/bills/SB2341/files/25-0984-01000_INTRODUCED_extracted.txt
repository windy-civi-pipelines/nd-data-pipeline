3 force and effect of law in the member states.
4 3. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a
5 statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years
6 of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
7 member state.
8 4. Rules or amendments to the rules must be adopted or ratified at a regular or special
9 meeting of the commission in accordance with commission rules and bylaws.
10 5. Before promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at

2 state shall enforce the compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
3 implement the compact.
4 b. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be
5 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the
6 principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue
7 and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
8 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing in the compact affects or
9 limits the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
10 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
11 c. The commission may receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
12 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in the

14 renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or
15 promulgated rules.

18 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the

24 states.
25 3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
26 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a supermajority of the delegates of the
27 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
28 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
29 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
30 period of default.
Page No. 17 25.0984.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 4. Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed after all other means of
2 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
3 must be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of
4 the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of
5 the member state's licensing authorities.

7 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
8 extend beyond the effective date of termination.
9 6. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, the state
10 immediately shall provide notice to all licensees within the state of the termination. The
11 terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this
12 compact for a minimum of six months after the date of the notice of termination.
13 7. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in
14 default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing
15 between the commission and the defaulting state.
16 8. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United
17 States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
18 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
19 the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
20 9. Dispute resolution.
21 a. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve
22 disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between
23 member and nonmember states.
24 b. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
25 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
26 10. Enforcement.
27 a. By majority vote as provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
28 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District
29 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices
30 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
31 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the

1 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded al l
2 costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein

4 pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
5 state's law.
6 b. A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United
7 States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
8 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of
9 the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both
10 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the

14 commission.

17 in the seventh member state.
18 a. On or after the effective date of the compact under subsection 1, the commission
19 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to
20 determine whether the statute enacted by each charter member state is
21 materially different than the model compact statute.

30 is subject to the process under subdivision v of subsection 3 of article VII to

1 determine if the enactment is materially different from the model compact statute
2 and whether the member state qualifies for participation in the compact.
3 c. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the
4 purposes of the administration of the compact before the effective date of the
5 compact or the commission coming into existence are considered to be actions of

7 (1) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial
8 adoption of the rules and bylaws is subject to the rules and bylaws as they

13 repealing the same.

18 requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
19 4. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall

23 minimum of six months after the date of the notice of withdrawal.

25 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state
26 and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
27 b. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to the
28 compact may become effective and binding upon any member state until it is
29 enacted into the laws of all member states.
30 ARTICLE XII - CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
Page No. 20 25.0984.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 1. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
2 so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the

7 provision of the compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
8 the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or
9 of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
10 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the

13 3. Notwithstanding subsection 2 of this section, the commission may deny a state's
14 participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 2 o f

17 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution
18 of any member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the
19 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected
20 as to all severable matters.
21 ARTICLE XIII - CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
22 1. Nothing in this compact may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a
23 member state that is consistent with the compact.

25 conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

4 3. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a

6 principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue
7 and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in

10 professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
11 c. The commission may receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the

15 promulgated rules.

24 states.
25 3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
26 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a supermajority of the delegates of the
27 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
28 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
29 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
30 period of default.

19 the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

22 disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between

28 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District
29 of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices
30 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
31 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded al l

5 state's law.

7 States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the

14 commission.

17 in the seventh member state.
18 a. On or after the effective date of the compact under subsection 1, the commission

13 repealing the same.

23 minimum of six months after the date of the notice of withdrawal.

25 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state
26 and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.

28 compact may become effective and binding upon any member state until it is

30 ARTICLE XII - CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
Page No. 20 25.0984.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 1. This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
2 so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
3 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
4 promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking
5 authority solely for those purposes.
6 2. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or
7 provision of the compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
8 the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or
9 of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
10 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
11 validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the compact to any
12 other government, agency, person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.
13 3. Notwithstanding subsection 2 of this section, the commission may deny a state's
14 participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 2 o f
15 article X, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if the commission
16 determines a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure
17 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution
18 of any member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the
19 remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected
20 as to all severable matters.

25 conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

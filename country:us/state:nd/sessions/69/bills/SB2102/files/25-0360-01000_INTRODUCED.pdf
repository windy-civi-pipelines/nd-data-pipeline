1 3. Any party who has been added, voluntarily or involuntarily, to the action or proceeding
2 after the date of any occurrence in subsection 2 has the right to file a demand for
3 change of judge within ten days after any remaining event occurs or, if all of those
4 events have already occurred, within ten days after that party has been added. In any
5 event, noa demand for a change of judge may not be made after the judge sought to
6 be disqualified has ruled uponon any matter pertaining to the action or proceeding in
7 which the demanding party was heard or had an opportunity to be heard. Any
8 proceeding to modify an order for alimony, property division, or child support pursuant
9 to section 14-05-24 or an order for child custody pursuant to section 14-05-22 must be
10 considered a proceeding separate from the original action and the fact that the judge
11 sought to be disqualified made any ruling in the original action does not bar a demand
12 for a change of judge.
13 4. The demand for change of judge must state that itthe demand is filed in good faith and
14 not for the purposes of delay. ItThe demand must indicate the nature of the action or
15 proceeding, designate the judge sought to be disqualified, the reason the change of
16 judge is sought, and certify that that judge has not ruled uponon any matter pertaining
17 to the action or proceeding in which the moving party was heard or had an opportunity
18 to be heard.
19 5. Upon the filing of the demand for change of judge, the clerk shall immediately shall
20 send a copy of the demand for a change of judge to the presiding judge of the judicial
21 district and the judge sought to be disqualified.
22 6. Upon receipt of a copy of a demand for change of judge, the judge sought to be
23 disqualified has no authority or discretion to determine the timeliness or validity of the
24 demand and shallmay not proceed noany further or take any action in the action or
25 proceeding and is thereafter disqualified from doing any further act in the cause unless
26 the demand is invalidated by the presiding judge. The judge sought to be disqualified
27 shall promptly shall submit to the presiding judge any comments the judge may have
28 regarding the demand. If the presiding judge thereafter invalidates the demand
29 because itthe demand was not timely filed timely, the reason for the change was not
30 based on reasonable grounds, or for other reasons, the judge sought to be disqualified

3 7. If a demand for a change of judge has been made and another judge assigned by the
4 presiding judge of the judicial district, the presiding judge may decline to grant another
5 demand for a change of judge made by a party whose interests in the matter are not
6 adverse to those of the party whose demand was granted. A judge assigned by the
7 presiding judge pursuant to a demand for change of judge is not disqualified upon a
8 subsequent demand for change of judge unless and until the subsequent demand is
9 granted and notice thereof is given to that judge by the presiding judge. A subsequent
10 demand for a change of judge may be made only within five days after receiving notice
11 of the assignment of a judge by the presiding judge pursuant to a previous demand.
12 8. Upon receipt of a timely filed demand for a change of judge from the clerk of the court,
13 the presiding judge of the judicial district in which the demand is filed shall promptly
14 shall designate another judge to act in the place and stead of the judge disqualified.

Definitions.
As used in this chapter, "encroachment" means an action that interferes with or negatively impacts
military base testing, training, and other operations and overall military readiness, including issues
related to environmental impact, noise pollution, land development, competition for airspace,
competition for radio frequency spectrum, and urban growth around military installations.
Military impact zones.
A military impact zone is a geographic zone extending from the perimeter of each military base in
the state, which requests the military compatibility committees to provide assistance under this chapter.
The outer boundary of each zone must be established by an assessment in a compatible use study and
contingent upon the missions of each military base.
Military compatibility committees.
1. The agriculture commissioner may create one or more military compatibility committees to
harmonize land, airspace, and electromagnetic spectrum use in military impact zones, review
potential encroachment of military installations in military impact zones, and promote the
sustainability of military operations in the state.
2. A military compatibility committee must be composed of:
a. The agriculture commissioner, or the agriculture commissioner's designee;
b. One representative from each county within the boundaries of a military impact zone,
selected by the board of county commissioners;
c. One representative representing all townships within the boundaries of a military impact
zone, selected by the boards of township supervisors;
d. One representative representing all cities within the boundaries of a military impact zone,
selected by the city council or councils; and
e. On a voluntary basis, the commander of each military installation, or the commander's
designee.
3. Except for activities subject to the United States department of defense military aviation and
installation assurance siting clearinghouse established under section 183(a) of United States
Code title 10 [10 U.S.C. 183(a)], a military compatibility committee shall:

and reenacted as follows:
15.1-07-25.4. Virtual learning - School district policy - Report to legislative management and
legislative assembly.
1. The board of a school district or governing board of a nonpublic school that operates a
physical school plant may adopt a policy to allow students to engage in virtual instruction and

2. A resident school district may not deny open enrollment to an approved virtual school.
2.3. A student or a student's family member may not receive any item, service, or thing of value not
given in exchange for fair market consideration from a vendor providing instruction or support

registration schedule and deadlines.
c. May require that students meet prerequisites to ensure readiness for sequential virtual
courses.
d. Must require the school district to pay for a virtual instruction course if the school district

meeting high school graduation requirements in time to graduate within the usual time
frame.
e. May establish the minimum number of courses a student is required to take onsite,
whether virtual or in person. The policy may not unreasonably restrict student access to
virtual school options and must comply with laws and administrative rules applicable to

instruction course retake.
4.6. The superintendent of public instruction shall provide an annual report to either the legislative

data.

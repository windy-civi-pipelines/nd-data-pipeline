equal percentages. If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has predeceased the member,
the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to the remaining primary
beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies before distribution of the
beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the beneficiary predeceased the
member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in the same manner. If there are no remaining
designated beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the member's
estate. If the member has not designated an alternate beneficiary or the surviving spouse is

spouse dies. A surviving spouse who received a benefit under this subsection as of

balance if the member has completed less than three years of eligible employment, has an
account balance of less than one thousand dollars, and was not a supreme or district court
judge or a peace officer employed by the bureau of criminal investigation and hired after

surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before the total amount of benefits paid to
either or both equals the amount of the member's account balance at retirement, the
difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit payment owed to the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary which was not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no

requests that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time

pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, if
any.

Section 15:

established by the board and a minimum period of participation of sixty months. If the political
subdivision withdraws from participation in the uniform group insurance program, before completing
sixty months of participation, unless federal or state laws or rules are modified or interpreted in a way
that makes participation by the political subdivision in the uniform group insurance program no longer

retirement plan may elect to participate in the uniform group under this chapter without meeting
minimum requirements at age sixty-five, when the employee's spouse reaches age sixty-five, upon the
receipt of a benefit, when the political subdivision joins the uniform group insurance plan if the retiree
was a member of the former plan, or when the spouse terminates employment. If a retiree or surviving
spouse does not elect to participate at the times specified in this section, the retiree or surviving spouse
must meet the minimum requirements established by the board. Each retiree or surviving spouse shall

require documentation that the retiree has accepted a retirement allowance from an eligible retirement
plan other than the public employees retirement system.

reduction of any retirement, pension, or other benefit provided by law. However, with the exception of
Roth contributions, any sum deferred under the deferred compensation program is not subject to
taxation until distribution is actually made to the employee. Any unpaid benefits under the deferred
compensation program established by this chapter are not subject to execution, garnishment,
attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or other process of law whatsoever, except
as provided by section 54-52.2-03.3. Neither the employee, the employee's beneficiary, nor any

employed during the last one hundred twenty months of employment. For members who
terminate employment on or after August 1, 2010, final average salary is the average of the
highest salary received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the last one
hundred eighty months of employment. For members who terminate employment between

received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the period for which the
board has appropriate and accurate salary records on the board's electronic database, but
that period may not be more than the last one hundred eighty months of employment. For
members who terminate employment after December 31, 2019, final average salary is the
higher of the final average salary calculated on December 31, 2019, or the average salary
earned in the three highest periods of twelve consecutive months employed during the last
one hundred eighty months of employment. Months without earnings are excluded for the

retirement date may choose to receive either a lump sum payment equal to the amount of
missed payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the member has selected,
which increase must reflect the missed payments.

subsection. If the member has designated an alternate beneficiary with the surviving spouse's
written consent, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the named beneficiary.
If the member has named more than one primary beneficiary, the board shall pay the
member's account balance to the named primary beneficiaries in the percentages designated
by the member or, if the member has not designated a percentage for the beneficiaries, in
equal percentages. If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has predeceased the member,
the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary's share to the remaining primary
beneficiaries. If any beneficiary survives the member, yet dies before distribution of the
beneficiary's share, the beneficiary must be treated as if the beneficiary predeceased the
member. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's
account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in the same manner. If there are no remaining
designated beneficiaries, the board shall pay the member's account balance to the member's
estate. If the member has not designated an alternate beneficiary or the surviving spouse is
the beneficiary, the surviving spouse of the member may select a form of payment as follows:
a. If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the surviving spouse may select one
of the following optional forms of payment:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payments as calculated for the deceased member as if the member was of normal
retirement age at the date of death, payable until the spouse dies.
b. The surviving spouse of all other members may select one of the following options:
(1) A lump sum payment of the member's retirement account as of the date of death.
(2) Payment of a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty percent of the deceased
member's accrued single life retirement benefits until the spouse dies.
(3) If the member dies on or after the member's normal retirement date, the payment of
a monthly retirement benefit equal to an amount that would have been paid to the
surviving spouse if the member had retired on the day of the member's death and
had selected a one hundred percent joint and survivor annuity, payable until the
spouse dies. A surviving spouse who received a benefit under this subsection as of
July 31, 1995, is entitled to the higher of that person's existing benefit or the
equivalent of the accrued benefit available under the one hundred percent joint and
survivor provision as if the deceased member were of normal retirement age, with
the increase payable beginning August 1, 1995.
7. If a member not coming under the provisions of subsection 6 terminates employment because
of death, permanent and total disability, or any voluntary or involuntary reason prior to
retirement, the member or the member's designated beneficiary is entitled to the member's
account balance at termination. The board automatically shall refund a member's account
balance if the member has completed less than three years of eligible employment, has an
account balance of less than one thousand dollars, and was not a supreme or district court
judge or a peace officer employed by the bureau of criminal investigation and hired after
July 31, 2023 . If the member was a supreme or district court judge, the board automatically
shall refund a member's account balance if the member completed less than five years of
eligible employment and has an account balance of less than one thousand dollars. If the
member was a peace officer employed by the bureau of criminal investigation and hired after
July 31, 2023, the board automatically shall refund a member's account balance if the member
completed less than ten years of eligible employment and has an account balance of less than
one thousand dollars. A member may waive the refund if the member submits a written
statement to the board, within thirty days after termination, requesting that the member's
account balance remain in the fund.

S. B. NO. 2121 - PAGE 7
8. The surviving spouse of a member receiving retirement benefits must be the member's
primary beneficiary unless there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse designates an
alternate beneficiary in writing. If a member receiving retirement benefits or the member's
surviving spouse receiving retirement benefits dies before the total amount of benefits paid to
either or both equals the amount of the member's account balance at retirement, the
difference must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no named
beneficiary, to the recipient's estate. A benefit payment owed to the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary which was not paid before the death of the member, surviving spouse,
or alternate beneficiary must be paid to the named beneficiary of the recipient or, if there is no
named beneficiary, to the recipient's estate.
9. a. The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the following
optional forms:
a. (1) Single life.
b. (2) An actuarially equivalent joint and survivor option, with fifty percent or one hundred
percent options.

d. (4) An actuarially equivalent partial lump sum distribution option with a twelve-month
maximum lump sum distribution.
e. (5) An actuarially equivalent graduated benefit option with either a one percent or two
percent increase to be applied the first day of January of each year.
b. Except for a supreme andor district court judgesjudge, unless a member specifically
requests that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time
of applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a single life
benefit. For a supreme andor district court judgesjudge, unless a member specifically
requests that the member receive benefits according to one of these options at the time
of applying for retirement, all retirement benefits must be in the form of a lifetime monthly
pension with fifty percent of the benefit continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, if
any.
10. The fund may accept rollovers from other eligible plans under rules adopted by the board for
the purchase of additional service credit, but only to the extent the transfer is a rollover
contribution that meets the requirement of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.
11. The board may accept trustee-to-trustee transfers as permitted by Internal Revenue Code
section 403(b)(13) and section 457(e)(17) from an Internal Revenue Code section 403(b)
annuity or Internal Revenue Code section 457 deferred compensation plan for the purchase of
permissive service credit, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 415(n)(3)(A) or as
repayment of a cashout from a governmental plan under Internal Revenue Code section
415(k)(3).
12. The board may establish individual retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities as
permitted under section 408(q) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow employees to make
voluntary employee contributions. The board may adopt rules to implement and administer the

established by the board and a minimum period of participation of sixty months. If the political
subdivision withdraws from participation in the uniform group insurance program, before completing
sixty months of participation, unless federal or state laws or rules are modified or interpreted in a way
that makes participation by the political subdivision in the uniform group insurance program no longer
allowable or appropriate, the political subdivision shall make payment to the board in an amount equal
to any expenses incurred in the uniform group insurance program that exceed income received on
behalf of the political subdivision's employees as determined under rules adopted by the board. The

agencies. A retiree who has accepted a retirement allowance from a participating political subdivision's
retirement plan may elect to participate in the uniform group under this chapter without meeting
minimum requirements at age sixty-five, when the employee's spouse reaches age sixty-five, upon the
receipt of a benefit, when the political subdivision joins the uniform group insurance plan if the retiree
was a member of the former plan, or when the spouse terminates employment. If a retiree or surviving
spouse does not elect to participate at the times specified in this section, the retiree or surviving spouse
must meet the minimum requirements established by the board. Each retiree or surviving spouse shall
pay directly to the board the premiums in effect for the coverage then being provided. The board may
require documentation that the retiree has accepted a retirement allowance from an eligible retirement
plan other than the public employees retirement system.

subdivision, and no deferral of income under the deferred compensation program shall effect a
reduction of any retirement, pension, or other benefit provided by law. However, with the exception of
Roth contributions, any sum deferred under the deferred compensation program is not subject to
taxation until distribution is actually made to the employee. Any unpaid benefits under the deferred
compensation program established by this chapter are not subject to execution, garnishment,
attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or other process of law whatsoever, except
as provided by section 54-52.2-03.3. Neither the employee, the employee's beneficiary, nor any

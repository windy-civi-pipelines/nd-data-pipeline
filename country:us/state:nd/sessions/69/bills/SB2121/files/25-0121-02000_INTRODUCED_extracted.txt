16 group insurance plan if the retiree was a member of the former plan, or when the spouse
17 terminates employment. If a retiree or surviving spouse does not elect to participate at the times
18 specified in this section, the retiree or surviving spouse must meet the minimum requirements
19 established by the board. Each retiree or surviving spouse shall pay directly to the board the
20 premiums in effect for the coverage then being provided. The board may require documentation
21 that the retiree has accepted a retirement allowance from an eligible retirement plan other than
22 the public employees retirement system.

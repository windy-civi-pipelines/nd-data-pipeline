14 qualifying veteran's death through application of a law that renders a surviving spouse
15 of a qualifying veteran eligible for United States department of veterans affairs

28 homestead, to a maximum amount calculated by multiplying eight thousand
29 one hundred dollars ofthe taxable valuation byof the disabled veteran's percentage of
30 interest in the homestead property and multiplying the result by the applicant's certified
31 disability percentage , not to exceed the maximum credit amount in subsection 1 .

2 section for the first time shall file with the county auditor an affidavit showing the facts
3 required under this section, a description of the property, and a certificate from the
4 United States department of veterans' affairs, or its successor, certifying to the amount
5 of the disability. The affidavit and certificate must be open for public inspection. A
6 person shall thereafter furnish to the assessor or other assessment officials, when
7 requested to do so, any information which supports the claim for credit for any
8 subsequent year.

10 "homestead":

21 represents the credit calculated in accordance with this section for any year in which
22 the qualifying owner has held title to the homestead property. Cancellation of taxes for
23 any year before enactment of this section must be based on the law that was in effect
24 for that tax year.
25 8. Before the first of March of each year, the county auditor of each county shall certify to
26 the tax commissioner on forms prescribed by the tax commissioner the name and
27 address of each person for whom the property tax credit for homesteads of disabled
28 veterans was allowed for the preceding year, the amount of credit allowed, the total of

19 educate students from a school district on an air force base with funding
20 received through federal impact aid each school year thereafter, until the
21 2024-25 school year when sixty-eight percent of tuition received under an
22 agreement to educate students from a school district on an air force base
23 with funding received through federal impact aid must be excluded from the
24 tuition calculation under this paragraph;
25 (4) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes on the distribution and transmission

1 d. An amount equal to the total revenue received by the school district during the
2 2017-18 school year for the following revenue types:
3 (1) Mobile home tax revenue;
4 (2) Telecommunications tax revenue; and
5 (3) Revenue from payments in lieu of taxes and state reimbursement of the

7 e. Beginning with the 2020-21 school year, the superintendent shall reduce the
8 baseline funding for any school district that becomes an elementary district
9 pursuant to section 15.1-07-27 after the 2012-13 school year. The reduction must
10 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
11 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
12 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
13 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
14 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district
15 becomes an elementary district and for each year thereafter. For districts that
16 become an elementary district prior to the 2020-21 school year, the
17 superintendent shall use the reduced baseline funding to calculate state aid for
18 the 2020-21 school year and for each year thereafter.

25 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
26 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district
27 becomes an elementary district to determine the district's adjusted baseline
28 funding per weighted student unit. The superintendent shall use the district's
29 adjusted baseline funding per weighted student unit in the calculation of state aid
30 for the first school year in which the school district becomes an elementary
31 district and for each year thereafter.

1 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the
2 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
3 unit. Each year the superintendent shall calculate the amount by which the
4 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit exceeds the payment per
5 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
6 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
7 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
8 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
9 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
10 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
11 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
12 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
13 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the
14 greater of:
15 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand six hundred
16 forty-six dollars;
17 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
18 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
19 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
20 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
21 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
22 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
23 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
24 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
25 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
26 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
27 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
28 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
29 seventy-two dollars;
30 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
31 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's

1 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
2 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
3 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
4 seventy-two dollars; or
5 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
6 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for
7 the 2024-25 school year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen
8 percent each school year thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero,
9 and then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
10 4. After determining the product in accordance with subsection 3, the superintendent of
11 public instruction shall:
12 a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the
13 school district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this
14 subdivision may not exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for
15 purposes of this subdivision by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to
16 section 15.1-27-04.3; and
17 b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
18 subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for
19 seventy-five percent of all revenue types, the superintendent of public instruction
20 shall adjust revenues as follows:
21 (1) Tuition revenue shall be adjusted as follows:
22 (a) In addition to deducting tuition revenue received specifically for the
23 operation of an educational program provided at a residential
24 treatment facility, tuition revenue received for the provision of an adult
25 farm management program, tuition received for the education of
26 high-cost and special education students, and tuition received under
27 an agreement to educate students from a school district on an
28 air force base with funding received through federal impact aid as
29 directed each school year in paragraph 3 of subdivision c of

14 5. The amount remaining after the computation required under subsection 4 is the

16 requirements or limitations.
17 6. On or before June thirtieth of each year, the school board shall certify to the
18 superintendent of public instruction the final average daily membership for the current
19 school year.

27 3. In determining the assessed value of real and personal property, except agricultural

14 qualifying veteran's death through application of a law that renders a surviving spouse
15 of a qualifying veteran eligible for United States department of veterans affairs
16 disability and indemnity compensation, the determination for purposes of the credit

28 homestead, to a maximum amount calculated by multiplying eight thousand
29 one hundred dollars ofthe taxable valuation byof the disabled veteran's percentage of
30 interest in the homestead property and multiplying the result by the applicant's certified
31 disability percentage , not to exceed the maximum credit amount in subsection 1 .

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 3. A disabled veteran or unremarried surviving spouse claiming a credit under this
2 section for the first time shall file with the county auditor an affidavit showing the facts
3 required under this section, a description of the property, and a certificate from the
4 United States department of veterans' affairs, or its successor, certifying to the amount
5 of the disability. The affidavit and certificate must be open for public inspection. A
6 person shall thereafter furnish to the assessor or other assessment officials, when
7 requested to do so, any information which supports the claim for credit for any
8 subsequent year.

10 "homestead":

21 represents the credit calculated in accordance with this section for any year in which
22 the qualifying owner has held title to the homestead property. Cancellation of taxes for
23 any year before enactment of this section must be based on the law that was in effect
24 for that tax year.
25 8. Before the first of March of each year, the county auditor of each county shall certify to

1 educate students from a school district on an air force base with funding
2 received through federal impact aid each school year thereafter, until the
3 2024-25 school year when sixty-eight percent of tuition received under an

22 be proportional to the number of weighted student units in the grades that are
23 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
24 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
25 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the
26 calculation of state aid for the first school year in which the school district

5 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the
6 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid.
7 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in
8 subsection 1 by the district's weighted student units after the school district

18 weighted student unit provided in subsection 3. For the 2023-24 school year the
19 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
20 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
21 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
22 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
23 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
24 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment
25 per weighted student unit provided in subsection 3.
26 3. a. For the 2023-24 school year, the superintendent shall calculate state aid as the

2 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
3 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by ten thousand
4 six hundred forty-six dollars; or
5 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
6 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by forty percent and
7 then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.
8 b. For the 2024-25 school year and each school year thereafter, the superintendent
9 shall calculate state aid as the greater of:
10 (1) The district's weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
11 seventy-two dollars;
12 (2) One hundred two percent of the district's baseline funding per weighted
13 student unit, as established in subsection 2, multiplied by the district's
14 weighted student units, not to exceed the district's 2017-18 baseline
15 weighted student units, plus any weighted student units in excess of the
16 2017-18 baseline weighted student units multiplied by eleven thousand
17 seventy-two dollars; or
18 (3) The district's baseline funding as established in subsection 1 less the
19 amount in paragraph 1, with the difference reduced by fifty-five percent for
20 the 2024-25 school year and the reduction percentage increasing by fifteen
21 percent each school year thereafter until the difference is reduced to zero,
22 and then the difference added to the amount determined in paragraph 1.

24 public instruction shall:
25 a. Subtract an amount equal to sixty mills multiplied by the taxable valuation of the
26 school district, except the amount in dollars subtracted for purposes of this
27 subdivision may not exceed the previous year's amount in dollars subtracted for
28 purposes of this subdivision by more than twelve percent, adjusted pursuant to
29 section 15.1-27-04.3; and
30 b. Subtract an amount equal to seventy-five percent of all revenue types listed in
31 subdivisions c and d of subsection 1. Before determining the deduction for

23 offered through another school district relative to the total number of weighted
24 student units the school district offered in the year before the school district
25 became an elementary district. The reduced baseline funding applies to the

4 b. For any school district that becomes an elementary district pursuant to section
5 15.1-07-27 after the 2017-18 school year, the superintendent shall adjust the
6 district's baseline funding per weighted student unit used to calculate state aid.
7 The superintendent shall divide the district's baseline funding determined in

13 district and for each year thereafter.
14 c. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year and for each school year thereafter, the

19 superintendent shall reduce the district's baseline funding per weighted student
20 unit by forty percent of the amount by which the district's baseline funding per
21 weighted student unit exceeds the payment per weighted student unit for the
22 2023-24 school year. For each year thereafter, the reduction percentage is
23 increased by an additional fifteen percent. However, the district's baseline funding
24 per weighted student unit, after the reduction, may not be less than the payment

14 - 14.2 - 08. Warrant to take physical custody of child .
1. If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds there is a credible risk
the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte
warrant to take physical custody of the child.
2. The court shall afford a respondent on a petition under subsection 1 an opportunity to be
heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the
next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold
the hearing on the first judicial day possible.
3. An ex parte warrant under subsection 1 to take physical custody of a child must :
a. Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful
removal of the child is based;
b. Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;
c. State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and
d. Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the court.
4. If feasible, before issuing a warrant and determining the placement of the child after the
warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the national
crime information center system and similar state databases to determine whether the
petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
5. The court shall serve the petition and warrant on the respondent at the time, or immediately
after, the child is taken into physical custody.
6. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is
enforceable. If the court finds a less intrusive remedy will not be effective, the court may
authorize a law enforcement officer to enter private property to take physical custody of the

S. B. NO. 2126 - PAGE 7
child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers
to make a forcible entry at any hour.
7. If the court finds, after a hearing, a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection 1
for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable
attorney's fees, costs, and expenses.
8. This chapter does not affect the availability of additional relief allowed under the law.

National Commerce Act [15 U.S.C. 7001, et seq.] but does not modify, limit, or supersede section
101(c) of the act or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103(b) of the

21 review available interstate compacts in professions it regulates to determine whether
22 joining the interstate compact would be in the best interest of the profession and state,
23 giving consideration to workforce shortages and evolving trends in occupation
24 licensure and technology. The review must be noted clearly in the board's agenda and
25 meeting minutes and the board must provide the labor commissioner with a copy of

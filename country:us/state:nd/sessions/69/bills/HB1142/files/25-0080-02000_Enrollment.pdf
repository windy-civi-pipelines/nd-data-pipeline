reenacted as follows:
32-12.1-03. Liability of political subdivisions - Limitations. (Effective through July 31,

circumstances in which the political subdivision, if a private person, would be liable to the

seventy-five thousand four hundred sixty - eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars per person

exemplary damages. The liability limits under this subsection must be adjusted annually as

person and one million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars for any single occurrence.
c. On July 1, 2025, a total of four hundred sixty-eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars
per person and one million eight hundred seventy-five thousand dollars per occurrence.

any license, permit, order, or other administrative approval or denial.
d. The decision to perform or the refusal to exercise or perform a discretionary function or
duty, whether or not such discretion is abused and whether or not the statute, charter,
ordinance, order, resolution, regulation, or resolve under which the discretionary function
or duty is performed is valid or invalid.
e. Injury directly or indirectly caused by a person who is not employed by the political
subdivision.
f. A claim relating to injury directly or indirectly caused by the performance or
nonperformance of a public duty, including:

demonstrated if all of the following elements exist:
(1) Direct contact between the political subdivision and the injured party.
(2) An assumption by the political subdivision, by means of promises or actions, of an
affirmative duty to act on behalf of the party who allegedly was injured.
(3) Knowledge on the part of the political subdivision that inaction of the political
subdivision could lead to harm.
(4) The injured party's justifiable reliance on the political subdivision's affirmative
undertaking, occurrence of the injury while the injured party was under the direct
control of the political subdivision, or the political subdivision action increases the
risk of harm.
4. This chapter does not obligate political subdivisions for an amount that is more than the
limitations upon liability imposed by this chapter. Subject to this chapter, any payments to
persons constitute payment in full of any compromised claim or judgment or any final
judgment under this chapter.

claim arising out of the conduct of a ridesharing arrangement, as defined in section 8-02-07.

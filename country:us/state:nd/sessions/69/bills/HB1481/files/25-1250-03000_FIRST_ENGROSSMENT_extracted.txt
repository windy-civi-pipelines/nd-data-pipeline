1 b. A dental insurer shall provide notice to all individuals and groups that were
2 covered under the plan during the applicable twelve-month period that such
3 individuals and groups are entitled to a refund on the premium, or if the individual

6 c. The total of all refunds issued under this subsection must equal the amount of the
7 dental insurer's earned premium which exceeds the amount necessary to
8 achieve a dental loss ratio of seventy-five percent, calculated using data reported

11 as follows :
12 (1) The numerator is the amount spent on care, which must include:
13 (a) The amount expended for clinical dental services that are services
14 within the code on dental procedures and nomenclature, provided to

10 fees or other contributions associated with the dental benefit plan.
11 (c) The denominator is the total amount of the earned premium revenues,

13 paid after accounting for any payments pursuant to federal law.
14 3. The commissioner may:
15 a. Authorize a waiver or adjustment of the refund requirements in this section only if
16 it is determined by the commissioner that issuing refunds would result in financial
17 impairment for the dental insurer.
18 b. Adopt rules to implement and administer this section.

SECTION 1. A new section to chapter 26.1-36.9 of the North Dakota Century Code is created and
enacted as follows:
Dental insurer rates - Approval.

Section 3:
1. The commissioner may deem a proposed plan rate of a dental insurer to be excessive and

Section 4:
2. a. If the annual dental loss ratio for a dental benefit plan is less than seventy-five percent,
the dental insurer offering the plan shall refund the excess premium to covered
individuals and groups. As used in this section, "dental loss ratio" means the ratio used to
determine the minimum percentage of all premium funds collected by a dental insurer
each year which must be spent on actual patient care rather than overhead costs. This
minimum required percentage that dental benefit plans must meet for the portion of
patient premiums must be dedicated to patient care rather than administrative and
overhead costs or the difference must be refunded as provided in this section.
b. A dental insurer shall provide notice to all individuals and groups that were covered under
the plan during the applicable twelve-month period that such individuals and groups are
entitled to a refund on the premium, or if the individual or group remains covered by the
dental insurer, that the individual or group is eligible for a credit on the premium for the
following twelve-month period.
c. The total of all refunds issued under this subsection must equal the amount of the dental
insurer's earned premium which exceeds the amount necessary to achieve a dental loss
ratio of seventy-five percent, calculated using data reported by the dental insurer.
d. The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator as
follows:
(1) The numerator is the amount spent on care, which must include:
(a) The amount expended for clinical dental services that are services within the
code on dental procedures and nomenclature, provided to enrollees which
includes payments under capitation contracts with dental providers, whose
services are covered by the contract for dental clinical services or supplies

subrogation vendor fees, and compensation to paraprofessionals, janitors,
quality assurance analysts, administrative supervisors, secretaries to dental
personnel, and dental record clerks.
(4) (a) The denominator is calculated using insurer revenue.
(b) The earned premium is all monies paid by a policyholder or subscriber as a
condition of receiving coverage from the issuer, including any fees or other
contributions associated with the dental benefit plan.

of all plans based on a three - year average .

plan contract shall file a dental loss ratio report with the commissioner by April thirtieth of each
year, in a manner prescribed by the commissioner.
H. B. NO. 1481 - PAGE 3

Section 9:
2. The dental loss ratio report must include dental loss ratio information for the last calendar year

loss ratio, in a manner that allows the public to compare dental loss ratios among dental
insurers by market type.

Section 12:
5. For purposes of this section, "dental loss ratio" has the same meaning as in section 1 of this
Act.

c. Any remaining revenues pursuant to subsection 3.
d. For purposes of this subsection, "fiscal year" means the period beginning September first
and ending August thirty-first of the following calendar year.
2. The tax revenue collected under this chapter equal to four percent of the gross value at the

remainder must be allocated to the state general fund. If the amount available for a monthly
allocation under this subsection is insufficient to deposit thirty percent of all revenue collected

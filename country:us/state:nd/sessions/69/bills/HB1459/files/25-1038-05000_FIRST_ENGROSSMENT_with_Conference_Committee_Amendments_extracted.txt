23 and gravel and rocks crushed for sand and gravel.
24 SECTION 2. A new section to chapter 38-12 of the North Dakota Century Code is created
25 and enacted as follows:
26 Declaration of policy for critical minerals and rare earth minerals.
27 1. It is in the public interest of the state of North Dakota, its citizens, and the United
28 States to encourage, accelerate, and promote the development, production, and
29 utilization of critical minerals and rare earth minerals in a manner that prevents waste,
30 allows a greater ultimate recovery of these natural resources, and protects the rights
31 of owners so the greatest possible economic recovery of these resources may be
Page No. 2 25.1038.05000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 obtained in this state and landowners, producers, and the general public may enjoy
2 the greatest possible good from these resources.
3 2. The legislative assembly acknowledges the public interest to foster, encourage, and
4 promote the development, production, and utilization of all natural resources of coal,
5 and the public interest is served by the preservation of existing coal conversion
6 facilities, which significantly contribute to the state economy and general public.
7 3. Development of critical minerals and rare earth minerals also may lead to significant
8 economic benefits for owners, new jobs in mining, processing, and related industries,
9 and contributions to the state economy. Many critical minerals and rare earth minerals
10 are broadly and irregularly disseminated and chemically bound, embedded,
11 commingled, included, or contained within coal. Certain owners are unable to develop
12 critical minerals and rare earth minerals because the minerals are contained within the
13 coal seam or coal deposit, are covered by an existing mining permit, and are subject
14 to the prior legal rights of the coal producer.
15 4. As reflected in federal policy, the legislative assembly recognizes critical minerals and
16 rare earth minerals are fundamental to the economy, competitiveness, and security of
17 the United States. The United States relies on foreign nations to supply these critical
18 minerals and rare earth minerals to develop and manufacture medical devices,
19 information technology, and equipment and technology for national defense, energy
20 infrastructure, and other critical items. Domestic development and production of critical
21 minerals and rare earth minerals is inadequate to meet the nation's needs. The United
22 States must have a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply to drive medical
23 manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries and to sustain
24 military preparedness, national security, and economic security.
25 5. This chapter provides potential for coal owners and critical mineral and rare earth
26 mineral owners to obtain added value from the development of critical minerals and
27 rare earth minerals extracted from coal. These critical minerals and rare earth minerals
28 are chemically bound, embedded, commingled, included, or contained within a coal
29 seam or coal deposit and cannot otherwise be produced on their own without
30 infringing on the working interests of the coal estate, without first mining the host
31 mineral coal, or in an economic manner.
Page No. 3 25.1038.05000

Legislative Assembly
1 6. To the maximum extent practicable, the critical mineral and rare earth mineral needs of
2 the United States should be satisfied by the vital natural resources responsibly
3 produced in the United States. The legislative assembly finds it necessary to declare
4 that the mining of coal in this state and a lease of coal in this state, whenever granted,
5 must include the right to all critical minerals and rare earth minerals chemically bound,
6 embedded, commingled, included, or contained within the coal unless specifically
7 excluded by the lease. A party is not obligated to mine, remove, or sell critical minerals
8 or rare earth minerals from coal. The legislative assembly finds that because critical
9 minerals and rare earth minerals are chemically bound, embedded, commingled,
10 included, or contained within a coal seam or coal deposit, and are not uniformly
11 disseminated, production must be commingled and a royalty rate must be applied only
12 if the minerals are extracted and sold. It is necessary to fulfill the public policy of this
13 state by clarifying law related to this policy and the development of critical minerals
14 and rare earth minerals.
15 7. Critical minerals and rare earth minerals occurring within or associated with coal-
16 bearing formations, coal seams, or coal combustion residuals are part of the coal
17 estate for purposes of ownership, leasing, taxation, and development unless expressly
18 severed by recorded conveyance. To help facilitate the extraction and processing of
19 critical minerals and rare earth minerals, the parties may amend an existing lease or
20 agree to new terms for any lease if agreed to by both parties.
21 8. Coal ash and any coal gasification product, including all minerals, substances,
22 compounds, byproducts, or elements contained therein which result from the
23 combustion or gasification of coal in a coal conversion facility are the property of the
24 owner or operator of the coal conversion facility. The owner or operator of a coal
25 conversion facility may not be held liable for waste, conversion, destruction, or
26 damages to any extent arising from the purchase, combustion, gasification, or sale of
27 any minerals, substances, compounds, byproducts, or elements contained within the
28 coal, coal ash, or products of coal.
29 9. For purposes of this section, "coal ash" includes fly ash, bottom ash, and boiler slag.
30 10. An operator shall pay any applicable mineral owner, according to each mineral
31 owner's respective undivided ownership of coal mined within the applicable permit
Page No. 4 25.1038.05000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 area during a calendar year, a royalty of no less than two and one-half percent of the
2 gross proceeds from all critical minerals and rare earth minerals mined, removed, and
3 sold during the extraction process. The royalty must be paid at least annually by
4 March thirty-first of the following year. For purposes of this section, "gross proceeds"
5 means the gross receipts received by an operator from any sale of critical minerals or
6 rare earth minerals which constitutes an arms-length transaction.
7 SECTION 3. AMENDMENT. Section 47-10-24 of the North Dakota Century Code is
8 amended and reenacted as follows:
9 47-10-24. Description and definition of minerals in leases and conveyances.
10 1. All conveyances of mineral rights or royalties in real property in this state, excluding
11 leases, shallmust be construed to grant or convey to the grantee thereof all minerals of
12 any nature whatsoever except those minerals specifically excluded by name in the
13 deed, grant, or conveyance, and their compounds and byproducts, but shallmay not
14 be construed to grant or convey to the grantee any interest in any gravel, clay, or
15 scoria unless specifically included by name in the deed, grant, or conveyance.
16 No
17 2. Except as provided in subsection 3, a lease of mineral rights in this state shallmay not
18 be construed as passing any interest to any minerals except those minerals
19 specifically included and set forth by name in the lease. For the purposes of this
20 paragraphsection, the naming of either a specific metalliferous element, or
21 nonmetalliferous element, and if so stated in lease, shall beis deemed to include all of
22 its compounds and byproducts, and in the case of oil and gas, all associated
23 hydrocarbons produced in a liquid or gaseous form so named shallmust be deemed to
24 be included in the mineral named. TheExcept as provided in subsection 3, the use of
25 the words "all other minerals" or similar words of an all-inclusive nature in any lease
26 shallmay not be construed as leasing any minerals except those minerals specifically
27 named in the lease and their compounds and byproducts.
28 3. As provided under section 2 of this Act, a lease of coal in this state whenever granted
29 is deemed to include all critical minerals and rare earth minerals chemically bound,
30 embedded, commingled, included, or contained within a coal seam or coal deposit
31 unless specifically excluded from the lease of coal.

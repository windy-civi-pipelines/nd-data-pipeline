1 4. "Owner" means the person who owns the critical minerals or rare earth elements.
2 5. "Rare earth elements" means any of a series of metallic elements of which the oxides
3 are classed as rare earths and which include the elements of the lanthanide series,
4 yttrium and scandium, which are embedded, commingled, included, contained within,
5 or in any way associated with any coal seam or deposit.
6 Jurisdiction of commission.
7 The commission has jurisdiction and authority necessary to enforce this chapter. The
8 commission may conduct investigations to determine whether facts exist which justify action by
9 the commission. The commission may:
10 1. Require an operator to:
11 a. Furnish a reasonable bond with good and sufficient surety, conditioned upon the
12 full compliance with this chapter, and the rules and orders of the commission
13 governing the exploration, development, and production of critical minerals or
14 rare earth elements on state and private lands within the state. The person
15 required to furnish the bond may elect to deposit a collateral bond, self-bond,
16 cash, or any alternative form of security approved by the commission, by which a
17 permittee assures faithful performance of all requirements of this chapter and the
18 rules and orders of the industrial commission. If a permit is issued for the
19 extraction of critical minerals or rare earth elements, in conjunction with a surface
20 coal mining permit issued under chapter 38 - 14.1, the bond for the surface coa l
21 mining permit may be used to satisfy the bond required under this chapter.
22 b. File production reports in the manner prescribed by the commission.
23 c. Conduct all exploration, development, and production operations in a manner as
24 to prevent pollution of freshwater supplies, to provide for the protection of the
25 environment and public safety, and to ensure the optimum recovery of the
26 mineral resource.
27 d. Reclaim all land distributed by operations required by this chapter to a condition
28 consistent with prior land use and productive capacity.
29 2. Regulate the the drilling and abandonment of exploration test holes and producing
30 wells and all other exploration, development, production, and reclamation operations.

1 3. Adopt and enforce rules and orders to effectuate this chapter, including rules requiring
2 an operator under permit with the commission to provide to the state geologist
3 reasonable amounts of data collected during the extraction process for critical
4 minerals or rare earth elements, and data necessary to evaluate the ongoing attributes
5 of critical mineral or rare earth extraction in the state.
6 4. Inspect all exploration, development, and production sites. The commission must have
7 access to all exploration, development, or production installations for purposes of
8 inspection and may require the operator's aid if necessary.
9 5. At the request of an operator, approve the commingling of production for any
10 extraction facility on land with diverse ownership. The commission shall establish a
11 method to measure production from each parcel of land with diverse ownership.
12 Permit required.

14 production of critical minerals or rare earth elements without first obtaining a permit
15 from the commission and paying the permit fee set by the commission.

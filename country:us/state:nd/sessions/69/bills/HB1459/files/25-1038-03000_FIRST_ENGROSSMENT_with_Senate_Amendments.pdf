Senators Hogue, Marcellais, Patten
1 A BILL for an Act to create and enact two new sections to chapter 38-12 of the North Dakota
2 Century Code, relating to critical minerals and rare earth minerals; to amend and reenact
3 section 38-12-01 of the North Dakota Century Code, relating to the definitions of critical
4 minerals and rare earth minerals; and to provide for a legislative management study.
5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
6 SECTION 1. Two new sections to chapter 38-12 of the North Dakota Century Code are
7 created and enacted as follows:
8 Declaration of policy for critical minerals and rare earth minerals.
9 1. It is in the public interest to encourage, accelerate, and promote the development,
10 production, and utilization of critical minerals and rare earth minerals in a manner that
11 prevents waste, allows a greater ultimate recovery of these natural resources, and
12 protects the rights of owners so the greatest possible economic recovery of these
13 resources may be obtained in the state, and landowners, producers, and the general
14 public may enjoy the greatest possible good from these resources.
15 2. As reflected in federal policy, the legislative assembly recognizes critical minerals and
16 rare earth minerals are fundamental to the economy, competitiveness, and security of
17 the United States. The United States relies on foreign nations to supply these critical
18 minerals and rare earth minerals to develop and manufacture medical devices,
19 information technology, and equipment and technology for national defense, energy
20 infrastructure, and other critical items. Domestic development and production of critical
21 minerals and rare earth minerals is inadequate to meet the nation's needs. The United
22 States must have a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply to drive the medical

1 manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries and to sustain
2 military preparedness, national security, and economic security.
3 3. Development of critical minerals and rare earth minerals also may lead to significant
4 economic benefits for owners; new jobs in mining, processing, and related industries;
5 and contributions to the state economy. Many critical minerals and rare earth minerals
6 are broadly and irregularly disseminated and chemically bound, embedded,
7 commingled, included, or contained within coal. It is necessary to fulfill the public
8 policy of the state by clarifying law related to this policy and for the development of
9 critical minerals and rare earth minerals.
10 Title to critical minerals and rare earth minerals.
11 Title to critical and rare earth minerals is vested in the owner of the mineral estate.
12 SECTION 2. AMENDMENT. Section 38-12-01 of the North Dakota Century Code is
13 amended and reenacted as follows:
14 38-12-01. Definitions.

16 SECTION 3. LEGISLATIVE MANAGEMENT STUDY - LEGAL AND TECHNICAL ISSUES
17 RELATED TO UNITIZING AND POOLING CRITICAL MINERALS AND RARE EARTH
18 MINERALS.
19 1. During the 2025-26 interim, the legislative management shall study the feasibility and
20 desirability of the unitization and pooling of critical minerals and rare earth minerals.
21 The study must include consideration of:
22 a. Any technical and legal barriers to the extraction and development of critical
23 minerals and rare earth minerals;
24 b. Current state laws on ownership and development of critical minerals and rare
25 earth minerals;
26 c. Appropriate royalty payments if critical minerals and rare earth minerals are
27 unitized and pooled, taking into consideration the value chain of the minerals;
28 d. The relative rights and risks of landowners, owners of mineral rights, extraction
29 companies, and processors; and
30 e. The appropriate regulatory framework for unitized and pooled critical minerals
31 and rare earth minerals.

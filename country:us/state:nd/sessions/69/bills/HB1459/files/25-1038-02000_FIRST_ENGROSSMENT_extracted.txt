4 finds it necessary to declare that the mining of coal in this state, and a lease of coal in this state
5 whenever granted must include the right to mine all critical minerals and rare earth elements,
6 unless specifically excluded by the lease.
7 Jurisdiction of commission.
8 The commission has jurisdiction and authority necessary to enforce this chapter. This
9 section does not apply to a mine under the jurisdiction and authority of the public service
10 commission under chapter 38 - 14.1. The commission may conduct investigations to determine
11 whether facts exist which justify action by the commission. The commission may:
12 1. Require an operator to:
13 a. Furnish a reasonable bond with good and sufficient surety, conditioned upon the
14 full compliance with this chapter, and the rules and orders of the commission
15 governing the exploration, development, and production of critical minerals or
16 rare earth elements on state and private lands within the state. The person
17 required to furnish the bond may elect to deposit a collateral bond, self-bond,
18 cash, or any alternative form of security approved by the commission, by which a
19 permittee assures faithful performance of all requirements of this chapter and the
20 rules and orders of the industrial commission. If a permit is issued for the
21 extraction of critical minerals or rare earth elements, in conjunction with a surface
22 coal mining permit issued under chapter 38 - 14.1, the bond for the surface coa l
23 mining permit may be used to satisfy the bond required under this chapter.
24 b. File production reports in the manner prescribed by the commission.
25 c. Conduct an extraction process in a manner as to prevent pollution of freshwater
26 supplies and to provide for the protection of the environment and public safety.
27 2. Adopt and enforce rules and orders to effectuate this chapter, including rules requiring
28 an operator under permit with the commission to provide to the state geologist
29 reasonable amounts of data collected during the extraction process for critical
30 minerals or rare earth elements, and data necessary to evaluate the ongoing attributes
31 of critical mineral or rare earth extraction in the state.

2 facilities for purposes of inspection and may require the operator's aid if necessary
3 and requested.
4 4. At the request of an operator, approve the commingling of production for any
5 processing facility on land with diverse ownership. The commission shall establish a
6 method to measure production from each parcel of land with diverse ownership.

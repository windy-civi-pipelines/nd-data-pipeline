10 condition for which the commissioner is required to secure and maintain the

27 records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records, financial records,
28 or similar records within the possession, custody or control of the affiliate. At the

30 set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's business, obtain access
31 to the operating systems on which the data is maintained, obtain the software

Legislative Assembly

9 3. A domestic insurer may not enter transactions that are part of a plan or series of like
10 transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose
11 of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus
12 avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner determines that the
13 separate transactions were entered over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the
14 commissioner may exercise the commissioner's authority under the penalty sections
15 of this chapter.
16 4. The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection 2, shall consider
17 whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection 1 and
18 whether they may adversely affect the interests of the policyholders.

20 domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in that corporation by
21 the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent of the corporation's voting
22 securities.
23 6. For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards
24 policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and
25 adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, must be
26 considered:

5 an extension is provided by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable
6 grounds shown.
7 15. The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration and scoped into

21 commissioners liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year unless
22 the lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the national
23 association of insurance commissioners financial stability task force or its
24 successor, determines the insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
25 that data year. An insurer that does not trigger at least one threshold of the scope
26 criteria is considered scoped out of the liquidity stress test framework for the

1 f. Expenses incurred and payment received must be allocated to the insurer in

3 g. If an insurer subject to this chapter is deemed by the commissioner to be in a
4 hazardous financial condition as defined by North Dakota Administrative Code
5 chapter 45 - 03 - 13 or a condition that would be grounds for supervision ,
6 conservation, or a delinquency proceeding, the commissioner may require the
7 insurer to secure and maintain a deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as
8 determined by the insurer at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the
9 insurer for the duration of the contracts or agreements, or the existence of the
10 condition for which the commissioner is required to secure and maintain the
11 deposit or the bond. In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
12 commissioner must consider whether concerns exist with respect to the affiliated
13 person's ability to fulfill the contracts or agreements if the insurer were to be put
14 into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a hazardous financial
15 condition or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation or a
16 delinquency proceeding, and a deposit or bond is necessary, the commissioner
17 may determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
18 contracts or agreements in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
19 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts, or a contract only with
20 specific persons.
21 h. All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and remain the property
22 of the insurer, are subject to the control of the insurer, are identifiable, and are

26 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files, premium
27 records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records, financial records,
28 or similar records within the possession, custody or control of the affiliate. At the
29 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall permit the receiver to obtain a complete
30 set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's business, obtain access
31 to the operating systems on which the data is maintained, obtain the software

1 that runs those systems either through assumption of licensing agreements or
2 otherwise, and restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating the

5 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement.
6 i. Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer which are collected by or held

10 2. The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its insurance
11 holding company system, including an amendment or modification of an affiliate
12 agreement previously filed pursuant to this section, which is subject to any materiality

16 may permit, and the commissioner has not disapproved it within that period. The
17 notice for an amendment or modification must include the reason for the change and
18 the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Within thirty days after a termination of a
19 previously filed agreement, informal notice must be reported to the commissioner for
20 determination of the type of filing required, if any.

22 provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:

25 as of December thirty-first next preceding.
26 (2) With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets
27 as of December thirty-first next preceding.
28 b. Loans or extensions of credit to any person that is not an affiliate, if the insurer

12 liabilities in any of the next three years, equals or exceeds five percent of
13 the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of December thirty-first
14 next preceding, including those agreements which may require as
15 consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an
16 agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that

18 insurer.
19 d. All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements,
20 guarantees, and cost-sharing arrangements.
21 e. Any guarantee made by a domestic insurer; however, a guarantee that is
22 quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirements of this
23 subsection unless the guarantee exceeds the lesser of one-half of one percent of
24 the insurer's admitted assets or ten percent of surplus as regards policyholders
25 as of December thirty-first next preceding. Additionally, all guarantees that are not
26 quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this
27 subsection.
28 f. Any direct or indirect acquisition or investment in a person that controls the
29 insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount that, together with its present
30 holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one-half percent of the insurer's
31 surplus to policyholders. A direct or indirect acquisition or investment in a

3 subject to this chapter, is exempt from this requirement.
4 g. Any material transactions, specified by rule, which the commissioner determines
5 may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.

8 company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.
9 3. A domestic insurer may not enter transactions that are part of a plan or series of like
10 transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose
11 of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus
12 avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner determines that the
13 separate transactions were entered over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the
14 commissioner may exercise the commissioner's authority under the penalty sections
15 of this chapter.
16 4. The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection 2, shall consider
17 whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection 1 and
18 whether they may adversely affect the interests of the policyholders.
19 5. The commissioner must be notified within thirty days of any investment of the
20 domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in that corporation by
21 the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent of the corporation's voting
22 securities.
23 6. For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards
24 policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and
25 adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, must be
26 considered:
27 a. The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves,
28 premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria.
29 b. The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines
30 of insurance.

8 j. The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The commissioner may treat
9 the investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy
10 of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the commissioner's judgment the
11 investment so warrants.
12 7. A domestic insurer may not pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other
13 extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until thirty days after the commissioner
14 has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period
15 disapproved the payment, or until the commissioner has approved the payment within
16 the thirty-day period.
17 8. For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any
18 dividend or distribution of cash or other property, when the fair market value together
19 with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months

22 thirty-first next preceding; or
23 b. The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the

25 gains, for the twelve-month period ending December thirty-first next preceding,

27 securities.
28 9. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary under subsection 8,
29 an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two
30 calendar years which has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward
31 must be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding
Page No. 15 25.8125.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second
2 and immediate preceding calendar years.
3 10. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary
4 dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner's approval, and the
5 declaration confers no rights upon shareholders until:
6 a. The commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution; or
7 b. The commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the thirty-day period
8 referred to in subsection 7.
9 11. An affiliate that is a party to an agreement or contract with a domestic insurer that is

12 and to the authority of any supervisor, conservator, rehabilitator, or liquidator for the

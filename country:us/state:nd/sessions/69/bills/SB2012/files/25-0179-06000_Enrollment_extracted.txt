subtracted from the total incorporated cities' share in the state as computed under
paragraph 1 and the balance remaining must then be divided by the total population

follows:
1. Sixty-one and three-tenthsSixty percent must be transferred monthly to the state department
of transportation and placed in a state highway fund.

incorporated cities' share. All the moneys received by the counties from the highway tax

S. B. NO. 2012 - PAGE 6
distribution fund must be set aside in a separate fund called the "highway tax distribution fund"
and must be appropriated and applied solely for highway purposes in accordance with
section 11 of article X of the Constitution of North Dakota. The state treasurer shall compute
and distribute monthly the sums allocated to the incorporated cities within each county
according to the formulas in this subsection using the incorporated cities' populations as
determined by the last official regular or special federal census or the census taken in
accordance with the provisions of chapter 40-02 in case of a city incorporated subsequent to
the census.
a. For counties having no cities with a population of ten thousand or more, twenty-seven
percent of the total county allocation must be distributed to all of the incorporated cities
within the county on a countywide per capita basis. The remaining county allocation
amount must be transferred into the county highway tax distribution fund.
b. For each county having a city with a population of ten thousand or more, the amount
transferred each month into the county highway tax distribution fund must be the
difference between the amount allocated to that county pursuant to this subsection and
the total amount allocated and distributed to the incorporated cities in that county as
computed according to the following formula:
(1) A statewide per capita average as determined by calculating twenty-seven percent
of the amount allocated to all of the counties under this subsection divided by the
total population of all of the incorporated cities in the state.
(2) The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of less than one
thousand must be determined by multiplying the population of that city by the
product of 1.50 times the statewide per capita average computed under
paragraph 1.
(3) The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of one thousand
to four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine, inclusive, must be determined by
multiplying the population of that city by the product of 1.25 times the statewide per
capita average computed under paragraph 1.
(4) The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of five thousand
or more must be determined by multiplying the population of that city by the
statewide per capita average for all such cities, which per capita average must be
computed as follows: the total of the shares computed under paragraphs 2 and 3 for
all cities in the state having a population of less than five thousand must be
subtracted from the total incorporated cities' share in the state as computed under
paragraph 1 and the balance remaining must then be divided by the total population
of all cities of five thousand or more in the state.
5. The moneys allocated to the incorporated cities must be distributed to them monthly by the
state treasurer and must be deposited by the cities in a separate fund and may only be used
in accordance with section 11 of article X of the Constitution of North Dakota and an
incorporated city may use the fund for the construction, reconstruction, repair, and
maintenance of public highways within or outside the city pursuant to an agreement entered
into between the city and any other political subdivision as authorized by section 54-40-08.

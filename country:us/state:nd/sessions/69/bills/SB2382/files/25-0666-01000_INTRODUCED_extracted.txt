13 Procedure - Vexatious litigant.
14 1. A presiding judge may designate a vexatious litigant upon motion by the court or at the
15 request of a party.
16 2. If the presiding judge finds there is a basis to conclude an individual is a vexatious
17 litigant and determines a prefiling order should be issued, the presiding judge shall
18 issue a proposed prefiling order and proposed findings in support of the order.
19 3. An individual determined by the presiding judge to be a vexatious litigant has fourteen
20 days to file a written response to the proposed order.
21 4. If a response is filed, the presiding judge may grant a hearing on the proposed order. If

23 a response or any subsequent hearings, and there is a basis for issuing the order, the

20 of this state as a self-represented party without first obtaining leave of a judge of the
21 court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.
22 2. If the supreme court finds there is a basis to conclude an individual is a vexatious

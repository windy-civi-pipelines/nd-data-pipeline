The emergency commission, with approval of the budget section of the legislative management if the
amount under consideration exceeds fifty thousand dollars, shall certify, by an approved motion
recorded in its minutes, that the material, services, or purposes for which the authority was transferred
are necessary and proper expenditures and, if an appropriation for that purpose was made by the
legislative assembly, that the appropriation for that purpose is insufficient. Approval by the budget
section of the legislative management is not required if the transfer is necessary to avoid an imminent
threat to the safety of people or property due to a natural disaster or war crisis or an imminent financial
loss to the state.

federal reimbursement for repair, recovery, or response relating to a disaster within the state, unless the

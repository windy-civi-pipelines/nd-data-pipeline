7 1. Except as provided in section 57-38-59.3, every employer making payment of wages

18 imposed by this chapter.
19 3. The tax commissioner may, in lieu of the requirement above for deducting and
20 withholding tax based upon a percentage of federal income tax withheld, adopt by rule
21 tax tables that, when the tax provided for in the tables is withheld, will, as closely as
22 possible, pay the income tax liability imposed by this chapter. When adopted by the
23 tax commissioner, said tables must be followed by every employer required to deduct
24 and withhold any tax imposed by this chapter.

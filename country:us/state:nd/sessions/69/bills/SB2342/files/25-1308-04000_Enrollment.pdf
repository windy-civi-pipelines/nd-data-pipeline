1. There is created in the state treasury the agriculture diversification and development fund. The

Moneys in the fund are appropriated to the Bank of North Dakota on a continuing basis for

shall designate the amount available from the fund for loans, interest rate buydowns, and
grants.
2. Loans, interest rate buydowns, or grants under subsections 3 and 4 may be issued from the
fund to support new or expanding value-added agriculture businesses that demonstrate
financial feasibility, enhance profitability for farmers and ranchers, create jobs, and grow the
state's economy. Grants under section 4.1-01-27 may be issued from the fund for
infrastructure improvements necessary for the development or expansion of new or existing
value-added agriculture businesses. Value-added agriculture businesses include food
production or processing facilities; feed or pet food processing facilities; commodity

to provide the Bank with information as requested. The Bank may develop policies for loan
participation with local financial institutions. The Bank shall deposit in the fund all principal and
interest paid on the outstanding loans. The Bank may use a portion of the interest paid as a
servicing fee to pay for administrative costs, which may not exceed one-half of one percent of
the amount of the outstanding loans. The fund must be audited annually pursuant to section
6-09-29, and the cost of the audit must be paid from the fund.
4. The agricultural diversification and development committee shall develop policies for grants
from the fund to support new or expanding value-added agriculture businesses, including

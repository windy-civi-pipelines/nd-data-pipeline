single state license.

home state license.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 7
the production of evidence from another member state must be enforced in the latter
state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure
applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court. The issuing
authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required
by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
2. Only the home state may have the power to take adverse action against a licensee's home
state license.
3. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect
to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred
within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
appropriate action.
4. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home
states during the course of the investigations. The home state must have authority to take
appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the
administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify

the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken
against that licensee.
6. A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote
state, provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.

a. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective state law, any
member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of
licensees.
b. Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in
furtherance of any joint investigations initiated under the compact.

in an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege in all other
member states must be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home
state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee
must include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are revoked in all member
states during the pendency of the order.
9. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license, as
certified by the home state's licensing authority, the licensee shall meet the requirements of
subsection 1 of article IV and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a
compact privilege in any remote state.
10. If a member state takes adverse action, the member state promptly shall notify the
administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system promptly shall notify
the other member states of any adverse actions.
11. Nothing in this compact may override a member state's decision that participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 14
ARTICLE X - RULEMAKING
1. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently
implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule has no force or
effect if a court of competent jurisdiction holds the rule is invalid because the compact
commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and
purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under the compact, or based upon another
applicable standard of review.
2. The rules of the compact commission must have the force of law in each member state,
provided that if the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state that relate to
the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that
state and the circumstances under which the licensed dietitian may do so, as held by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission are ineffective in that state to
the extent of the conflict.
3. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria and
rules set forth and adopted under this section. Rules become binding on the day following
adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
4. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four
years of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
member state.
5. Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
6. Before adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing and
allow individuals to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
7. Before adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty days in
advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the
proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
a. On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;
b. To persons who have requested notice of the compact commission's notices of proposed
rulemaking; and
c. In such other way as the compact commission may by rule specify.
8. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
a. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission will
hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location
of the meeting at which the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed
rule;
b. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the
hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
c. The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the rule;
d. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
e. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 15
9. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to
the public.
10. Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this
section.
11. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
a. The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes
do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
b. The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not
made that were recommended by commenters.
c. The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except
for an emergency as provided in subsection 12 of article X, the effective date of the rule
must be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that the commission adopted
or amended the rule.
12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and
adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hours notice and with opportunity to comment,
provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section
must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
a. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
b. Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
c. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or
d. Protect public health and safety.
13. The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may direct
revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in
format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision must be
posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision must be subject to challenge
by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in
writing and delivered to the compact commission before the end of the notice period. If no
challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is
challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission.
14. A member state's rulemaking requirements may not apply under this compact.
ARTICLE XI - OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
1. Oversight.
a. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall
enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this
compact.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 16
b. Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings
by or against the compact commission must be brought solely and exclusively in a court
of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the compact commission is located.
The compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
c. The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any
proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have
standing to intervene in that proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact
commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact
commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.
a. If the compact commission determines a member state has defaulted in the performance
of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the
compact commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of
default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any
other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training and specific
technical assistance regarding the default.
b. The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
member states.
3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all
rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be
given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member
states licensing authority.
5. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
effective date of termination.
6. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees within that state of the termination. The terminated state shall
continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum
of six months after the date of the notice of termination.
7. The compact commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in
default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between
the compact commission and the defaulting state.
8. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the
United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
compact commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs
of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
9. Dispute resolution.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 17
a. Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve
disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member
and nonmember states.
b. The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and
binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
10. Enforcement.
a. By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a
member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including
reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of
the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
b. A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the United
States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must
be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
c. No party other than a member state may enforce this compact against the compact
commission.
ARTICLE XII - EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
1. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
law in the seventh member state.
a. On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and
review the enactment of each of the first seven member states, "charter member states",
to determine if the statute enacted by each charter member state is materially different
than the model compact statute.
(1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
model compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article XI .
(2) If any member state is later found to be in default, is terminated, or withdraws from
the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact
shall remain in effect even if the number of member states is less than seven.
b. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member
states must be subject to the process set forth in subdivision u of subsection 3 o f
article VIII to determine if the member state's enactments are materially different from the
model compact statute and whether the member states qualify for participation in the
compact.
c. All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the
purposes of the administration of the compact before the effective date of the compact or
the compact commission coming into existence must be considered to be actions of the
compact commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 18
d. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission's initial adoption
of the rules and bylaws is subject to the rules and bylaws as the rules and bylaws exist
on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been
adopted previously by the compact commission must have the full force and effect of law
on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
2. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
compact.
a. A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until one hundred eighty days after
enactment of the repealing statute.
b. Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing
authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of
this compact before the effective date of withdrawal.
c. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state immediately shall
provide notice of the withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any
subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, the withdrawing state shall continue to
recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one
hundred eighty days after the date of the notice of withdrawal.
3. Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember
state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
4. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all
member states.
ARTICLE XIII - CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
1. This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact.
Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not
be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority solely for those
purposes.
2. The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United
States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held
to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this
compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
3. Notwithstanding subsection 2, the compact commission may deny a state's participation in the
compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection 2 of article XI, terminate a
member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement
of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must
be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full
force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the
member state affected as to all severable matters.
ARTICLE XIV - CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
1. Nothing herein may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
is not inconsistent with the compact.

S. B. NO. 2223 - PAGE 19
2. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with
the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
3. All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states are
binding in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

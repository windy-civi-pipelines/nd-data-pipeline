25 been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that
26 impose adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the licensee's
27 compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.

1 ARTICLE X - RULEMAKING
2 1. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and
3 efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A
4 rule has no force or effect if a court of competent jurisdiction holds the rule is invalid
5 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that
6 is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under the
7 compact, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
8 2. The rules of the compact commission must have the force of law in each member
9 state, provided that if the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state
10 that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted
11 to undertake in that state and the circumstances under which the licensed dietitian
12 may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact
13 commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
14 3. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
15 and rules set forth and adopted under this section. Rules become binding on the day
16 following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is

18 4. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule,
19 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact
20 within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force
21 and effect in any member state.
22 5. Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
23 6. Before adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public
24 hearing and allow individuals to provide oral and written comments, data, facts,
25 opinions, and arguments.
26 7. Before adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty
27 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public
28 hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of
29 proposed rulemaking:
30 a. On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;
Page No. 20 25.0824.01000

4 8. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
5 a. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact
6 commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the
7 time, date, and location of the meeting at which the compact commission will
8 consider and vote on the proposed rule;
9 b. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
10 communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access
11 to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
12 c. The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the rule;
13 d. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
14 e. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

16 documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule
17 must be available to the public.
18 10. Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
19 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings
20 required by this section.
21 11. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on
22 the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

30 date of the rule must be no sooner than thirty days after issuing the notice that

Page No. 21 25.0824.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider

16 any revision must be posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision
17 must be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting.
18 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
19 change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the compact
20 commission before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision
21 will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
22 take effect without the approval of the compact commission.

27 shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
28 implement this compact.

Page No. 22 25.0824.01000
Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue and

4 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
5 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
6 c. The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any
7 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall
8 have standing to intervene in that proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide

10 as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
11 2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.
12 a. If the compact commission determines a member state has defaulted in the
13 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the
14 promulgated rules, the compact commission shall provide written notice to the

16 means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission
17 may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
18 default.

22 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the
23 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
24 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
25 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
26 period of default.
27 4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means
28 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
29 must be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority
30 leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority,
31 and each of the member states licensing authority.

9 in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing
10 between the compact commission and the defaulting state.

12 the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where

14 awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

20 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
21 10. Enforcement.

23 a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of
24 Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
25 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
26 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
27 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
28 must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
29 The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
30 commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available

17 immediately shall provide notice of the withdrawal to all licensees within that

1 ARTICLE X - RULEMAKING
2 1. The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and
3 efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A
4 rule has no force or effect if a court of competent jurisdiction holds the rule is invalid
5 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that
6 is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under the
7 compact, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
8 2. The rules of the compact commission must have the force of law in each member
9 state, provided that if the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state
10 that relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted
11 to undertake in that state and the circumstances under which the licensed dietitian
12 may do so, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact
13 commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
14 3. The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
15 and rules set forth and adopted under this section. Rules become binding on the day
16 following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is

18 4. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule,
19 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact
20 within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force
21 and effect in any member state.
22 5. Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
23 6. Before adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public
24 hearing and allow individuals to provide oral and written comments, data, facts,
25 opinions, and arguments.
26 7. Before adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty
27 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public
28 hearing on the proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of
29 proposed rulemaking:
30 a. On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;

4 8. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
5 a. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact
6 commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the
7 time, date, and location of the meeting at which the compact commission will
8 consider and vote on the proposed rule;
9 b. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
10 communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access
11 to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
12 c. The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the rule;
13 d. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
14 e. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
15 9. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
16 documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule
17 must be available to the public.
18 10. Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
19 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings
20 required by this section.
21 11. The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on
22 the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

1 12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider
2 and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four hours notice and with opportunity to

17 must be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting.
18 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
19 change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the compact
20 commission before the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision
21 will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
22 take effect without the approval of the compact commission.

Page No. 22 25.0824.01000

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue and
2 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
3 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
4 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
5 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
6 c. The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any
7 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall
8 have standing to intervene in that proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide

10 as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
11 2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.
12 a. If the compact commission determines a member state has defaulted in the
13 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the
14 promulgated rules, the compact commission shall provide written notice to the

16 means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission
17 may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
18 default.
19 b. The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
20 member states.
21 3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated
22 from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the
23 member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this
24 compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
25 does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
26 period of default.
27 4. Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means
28 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
29 must be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority
30 leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority,
31 and each of the member states licensing authority.

12 the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where

14 awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

20 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
21 10. Enforcement.

23 a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of
24 Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
25 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
26 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
27 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
28 must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
29 The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
30 commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available

17 immediately shall provide notice of the withdrawal to all licensees within that

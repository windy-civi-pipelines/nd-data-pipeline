Section 1:
Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3016
(Representatives Novak, D. Anderson, Heinert, J. Olson, Porter)
(Senators Hogue, Patten)
A concurrent resolution recognizing the benefits of enhanced oil recovery and encouraging the State of
North Dakota and federal government to maintain favorable policies that support the
development of carbon capture technology and utilization of carbon dioxide as a commodity for
advancing energy security.
WHEREAS, the Bakken Formation is a world-class energy resource yielding 1.2 million barrels of
oil per day; and
WHEREAS, North Dakota's oil industry contributes approximately $8 million per day in extraction
and production tax revenues, $26 billion since 2008, and over half of total state tax revenues annually;
and
WHEREAS, oil and gas tax revenues contribute to the well-being of the state, providing a stable tax
base, prospering economy, well-paying jobs, and energy security; and
WHEREAS, current recovery methods produce only a small portion of the Bakken Formation's
estimated oil in place; and
WHEREAS, it is estimated that utilization of enhanced oil recovery methods could unlock several
billion barrels more of incremental oil production, and extend Bakken Formation production by several
decades; and
WHEREAS, North Dakota's coal industry supports nearly 12,000 jobs in the state, contributes
$2 billion in gross domestic product, and $100 million in state and local tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, the coal industry has been a leader in pursuing technologies to capture carbon dioxide
from its coal-fired power and gasification facilities; and
WHEREAS, carbon dioxide captured from North Dakota's energy and agriculture facilities is a
valuable commodity that will be necessary to achieve full deployment of enhanced oil recovery in North
Dakota's oil shale formations and conventional reservoirs; and
WHEREAS, the state has been a leader in investing in research and development to unleash the
full potential of all its energy resources, and in creating a regulatory environment that fosters the
development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies; and
WHEREAS, successful deployment of enhanced oil recovery will unlock the full potential of the
Bakken Formation, enhance North Dakota's coal industry, and support the continued growth of North
Dakota's energy industries, supporting the Trump Administration's goals of achieving energy dominance
and energy security;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NORTH
DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly recognize the benefits of enhanced oil recovery and
encourage the State of North Dakota and federal government to maintain favorable policies that support
the development of carbon capture technology and utilization of carbon dioxide as a commodity for
advancing energy security; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to develop policies that
encourage and incentivize utilization of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery; and
H.C.R. NO. 3016 - PAGE 2
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government is urged to increase its partnership with
the State of North Dakota and its energy industries to advance carbon capture technologies and
enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken Formation; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution to the
President of the United States, the Secretary of the Department of Energy, the Secretary of the
Department of the Interior, and each member of the North Dakota Congressional Delegation.

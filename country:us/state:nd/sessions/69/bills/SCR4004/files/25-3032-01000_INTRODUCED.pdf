Legislative Assembly SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4004
of North Dakota
Introduced by
Senators Mathern, Rummel
Representatives Foss, Hanson, Murphy
1 A concurrent resolution declaring April 21, 2025, through April 28, 2025, as "North Dakota Dark
2 Sky Week," and urging the residents of North Dakota to partake in this event to observe,
3 ponder, and support the natural dark sky resources of this state.
4 WHEREAS, collisions with glass surfaces cause about one billion bird deaths in the United
5 States each year, contributing to a 29 percent decline in North American bird populations since
6 1970; and
7 WHEREAS, over half of North America's breeding birds are migratory, with more than
8 80 percent migrating at night, and during migration, lights can cause birds to collide with
9 windows or walls, causing injury, exhaustion, confusion, or death; and
10 WHEREAS, North Dakota is located along the Central Flyway, with its eastern border on
11 the edge of the Mississippi Flyway, a significant neotropical migratory pathway, where
12 approximately 450 million birds migrate through North Dakota in the spring and 400 million each
13 fall, and on peak migration nights, as many as 35 million birds migrate over the state; and
14 WHEREAS, eliminating nonessential indoor and exterior lighting during the spring and fall
15 migration can significantly reduce bird mortality; and
16 WHEREAS, private organizations supporting North Dakota Dark Sky Week encourage
17 state, municipal, residential, and commercial building owners, operators, managers, and
18 tenants to turn off, dim, or redirect excess lighting during migration seasons to protect birds from
19 light pollution and help provide safer passage between bird nesting and wintering grounds; and
20 WHEREAS, in addition to protecting the birds of the state, the implementation of a
21 statewide North Dakota Dark Sky Week may save millions in energy costs, increase energy
22 security, and help reduce energy carbon emissions in alignment with North Dakota's Priority
23 Climate Action Plan; and

Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, Studies have shown that soybeans and other crops are sensitive to exposure
2 to light pollution, in addition to high risks to pollinator species of insects such as honeybees and
3 moths; and
4 WHEREAS, Light pollution has been demonstrated to have links to a wide variety of human
5 health concerns including cancer, obesity, diabetes, and mental health disorders stemming from
6 disruption of our circadian rhythm and the loss of awe and wonder a night sky can provide; and
7 WHEREAS, 90 percent of the world's population, including most of the state's residents in
8 the six most populous counties, live under a dome of light pollution that denies them a critical
9 connection to a shared cultural and historical heritage;
10 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF NORTH DAKOTA, THE
11 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN:
12 That the state declares the week of April 21, 2025, through April 28, 2025, be North Dakota
13 Dark Sky Week, and encourages state, municipal, and commercial building owners, operators,
14 managers, and tenants to participate in this event to spread awareness of light pollution and
15 mitigation techniques and voluntarily turn off unnecessary lights throughout the migration
16 season; and
17 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Secretary of State forward copies of this resolution to
18 the Director of the North Dakota Tourism and Marketing Division, the Director of the North
19 Dakota Parks and Recreation Department, the Executive Committee of the North Dakota
20 Association of Counties, the President of the North Dakota Township Officers Association, and
21 the Executive Board of the North Dakota League of Cities.

act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including by showing
the efficacy of a security procedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic

attested by another individual in the presence of the individual signing the document, the
presence requirement is satisfied if the individuals are in each other's electronic presence.

generated in final form as an electronic record or under section 59 - 22 - 11; and

4. If any other provision of law requires a nontestamentary estate planning document to be
presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if a nontestamentary

retained in accordance with subsection 1 satisfies the other law .

retention of a record subject to the agency's jurisdiction in addition to those in this section.
6. As used in this section, "governmental agency" means an executive, legislative, or judicial
agency, department, board, commission, authority, institution, or instrumentality of the federal

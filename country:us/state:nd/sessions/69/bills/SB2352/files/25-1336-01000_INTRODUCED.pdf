2 Dakota Century Code, relating to authorization for children of inmates to reside at the Heart
3 River correctional center; and to amend and reenact section 32-12.2-02 of the North Dakota
4 Century Code, relating to limitation of liability for children residing at the Heart River correctional
5 center.
6 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORTH DAKOTA:
7 SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 32-12.2-02 of the North Dakota Century Code is
8 amended and reenacted as follows:
9 32-12.2-02. Liability of the state - Limitations - Statute of limitations. (Effective
10 through July 31, 2027)
11 1. The state may only be held liable for money damages for an injury proximately caused
12 by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a state employee acting within the
13 employee's scope of employment under circumstances in which the employee would
14 be personally liable to a claimant in accordance with the laws of this state, or an injury
15 caused from some condition or use of tangible property under circumstances in which
16 the state, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant. No claim may be brought
17 against the state or a state employee acting within the employee's scope of
18 employment except a claim authorized under this chapter or otherwise authorized by
19 the legislative assembly. The enactment of a law, rule, or regulation to protect any
20 person's health, safety, property, or welfare does not create a duty of care on the part
21 of the state, its employees, or its agents, if that duty would not otherwise exist.
22 2. The liability of the state under this chapter is limited to a total of three hundred
23 seventy-five thousand dollars per person and one million dollars for any number of
24 claims arising from any single occurrence. The state may not be held liable, or be

5 present proof of the judgment to the director of the office of management and budget
6 who shall include within the proposed budget for the office of management and budget
7 a request for payment for the portion of the judgment in excess of the limit under this
8 section at the next regular session of the legislative assembly after the judgment is
9 rendered. The liability limits under this subsection must be adjusted annually as

25 in the execution of a valid or invalid statute or rule.
26 b. A claim based upon a decision to exercise or perform or a failure to exercise or
27 perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of the state or its employees,
28 regardless of whether the discretion involved is abused or whether the statute,

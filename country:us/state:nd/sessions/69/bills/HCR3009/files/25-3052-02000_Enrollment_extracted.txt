Section 1:
Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3009
(Representatives J. Olson, Dockter, Heinert, Novak, M. Ruby)
(Senators Gerhardt, Kessel, Patten)
A concurrent resolution urging the federal government to take actions to enact trade policy that supports
business and workers of the United States while penalizing global polluters.
WHEREAS, Chinese government-owned industry is an arm of the Communist Party and strives to
increase its influence over the global economy by pursuing predatory, unfair trade practices designed to
steal intellectual property and destroy competition from the United States; and
WHEREAS, China is the greatest immediate obstacle to reducing global pollution and accounts for
one-third of global emissions, more than the rest of the developed world combined, while it subsidizes
its exports by not imposing or enforcing environmental and labor standards comparable to those in
other developed nations; and
WHEREAS, private sector innovation and American resources have led the United States to
eliminate more emissions than any other country in the last fifteen years; and
WHEREAS, the United States' economy is 44 percent more carbon efficient than the world
average; and
WHEREAS, goods produced in China and Russia generate 300 and 400 percent on average,
respectively, more in carbon emissions compared to equivalent goods produced in the United States;
and
WHEREAS, 75 percent of the goods the United States imports are from higher-polluting countries,
and yet the United States is forced to compete with subsidized imports from China and elsewhere that
face few limits on how much they pollute; and
WHEREAS, regulatory policies have blocked resource development on public lands in North
Dakota, resulting in the United States importing over 80 percent of its critical minerals from foreign
sources, with China controlling 85 percent of global processing capacity, thus enriching China and
undermining domestic mineral production capabilities; and
WHEREAS, these federal environmental policies have harmed all North Dakotans by reducing
revenue by an estimated $1.2 billion to the state and royalties to mineral owners; and
WHEREAS, holding foreign polluters to the same standards as domestic producers would provide a
plethora of benefits to the state of North Dakota, including diversifying supply chains by reducing the
United States' dependence on imports from high-emitting producers like Russia and China, decreasing
global pollution by holding the biggest polluters accountable to western environmental standards, and
bolstering domestic manufacturing and generating well-paying jobs in rural areas;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NORTH
DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges the federal government to support trade policies
that hold high-polluting countries like China and Russia accountable for pollution and bolster domestic
extraction and production; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward a copy of this resolution to the
President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the
H.C.R. NO. 3009 - PAGE 2
President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and each member of the North Dakota
Congressional Delegation.

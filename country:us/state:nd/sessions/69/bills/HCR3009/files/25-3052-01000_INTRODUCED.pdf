Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3009
of North Dakota
Introduced by
Representatives J. Olson, Dockter, Heinert, Novak, M. Ruby
Senators Gerhardt, Kessel, Patten
1 A concurrent resolution urging the federal government to take actions to enact trade policy that
2 supports business and workers of the United States while penalizing global polluters.
3 WHEREAS, Chinese government-owned industry is an arm of the Communist Party and
4 strives to increase its influence over the global economy by pursuing predatory, unfair trade
5 practices designed to steal intellectual property and destroy competition from the United States;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, China is the greatest immediate obstacle to reducing global pollution and
8 accounts for one-third of global emissions, more than the rest of the developed world combined,
9 while it subsidizes its exports by not imposing or enforcing environmental and labor standards
10 comparable to those in other developed nations; and
11 WHEREAS, private sector innovation and American resources have led the United States
12 to eliminate more emissions than any other country in the last fifteen years; and
13 WHEREAS, the United States' economy is 44 percent more carbon efficient than the world
14 average; and
15 WHEREAS, goods produced in China and Russia generate 300 and 400 percent on
16 average, respectively, more in carbon emissions compared to equivalent goods produced in the
17 United States; and
18 WHEREAS, 75 percent of the goods the United States imports are from higher-polluting
19 countries, and yet the United States is forced to compete with subsidized imports from China
20 and elsewhere that face few limits on how much they pollute; and
21 WHEREAS, regulatory policies have blocked resource development on public lands in
22 North Dakota, resulting in the United States importing over 80 percent of its critical minerals
23 from foreign sources, with China controlling 85 percent of global processing capacity, thus
24 enriching China and undermining domestic mineral production capabilities; and

Sixty-ninth
Legislative Assembly
1 WHEREAS, these federal environmental policies have harmed all North Dakotans by
2 reducing revenue by an estimated $1.2 billion to the state and royalties to mineral owners; and
3 WHEREAS, holding foreign polluters to the same standards as domestic producers would
4 provide a plethora of benefits to the state of North Dakota, including diversifying supply chains
5 by reducing the United States' dependence on imports from high-emitting producers like Russia
6 and China, decreasing global pollution by holding the biggest polluters accountable to western
7 environmental standards, and bolstering domestic manufacturing and generating well-paying
8 jobs in rural areas;
9 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
10 NORTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
11 That the Sixty-ninth Legislative Assembly urges the federal government to support trade
12 policies that hold high-polluting countries like China and Russia accountable for pollution and
13 bolster domestic extraction and production; and
14 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State forward a copy of this resolution
15 to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of
16 Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, and each member of
17 the North Dakota Congressional Delegation.
